<h2 class="no-brk"><a id="PREFACE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PREFACE</a></h2>

<div class="front">
<p>This book is intended as a manual for teachers of reading
in the public schools. In its preparation the theory was,
first, that the teacher should have a thorough knowledge of
how thought and feeling are expressed&mdash;in other words he
must have the criteria of expression; and, second, that he
should have a definite graded method of instruction, in which
the simple shall precede the complex, and in which one
element, and one only, shall be presented at a time.</p>

<p>The book is, therefore, an endeavor to assist the teacher of
reading, first, by explaining the psychology of the criteria of
expression; second, by presenting a practical method of instruction;
and, third, by discussing certain definite principles
of literary interpretation.</p>

<p>Parts of this book have been given to the public by the
author, in <cite>Principles of Vocal Expression</cite> and <cite>How to Read
Aloud</cite>, the latter of which is now out of print. The interest
in these two books is a cause for gratitude and it is hoped the
present manual may serve its purpose equally well.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<div class="front">
<p>It is universally conceded that the public schools fail to
give children much power as readers. One authority asserts
that, after the child’s twelfth year, his ability as a reader
steadily declines. (Up to that time he is gradually acquiring
greater mastery over words, and so, in a sense, may be said to
be improving.) Testimony can be added that, by the time he
reaches the university, the average student cannot read at all.</p>

<p>Many remedies have been suggested, from which two may
be selected as typical. One is to call the attention of the
child to the mechanics of vocal expression&mdash;to inflection, force,
movement, and so forth. The other (that commonly
employed), to tell the child to get the thought. It cannot be
denied that both methods have, in isolated cases, been productive
of some good, yet, on the whole, they have been
well-nigh barren of results. Let us inquire briefly into the
causes.</p>

<p>The mechanical method fails, especially with younger
people, because it is dry, technical, unstimulating, and, in
the main, uninteresting. It deals with rules for the use of
the different elements of vocal expression, telling the child he
must use a rising inflection here, a falling inflection there;
that he must read parenthetical phrases and clauses in lower
pitch and faster time; that this emotion should be manifested
in normal quality, that emotion in orotund quality; and so on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
through weary, dreary rules and principles, the study of
which has seldom done any good and oftentimes much harm.
The “get-the-thought” method is a revolt against the other
plan. Recognizing the fact that drills in the elements have
done nothing toward elevating the standard of reading, the
conscientious principal or superintendent tells his teachers that
they must see to it that the scholars get the thought. This
is a step in the right direction, but it must be acknowledged
that it does not produce results. And the chief reasons for
this are two. First, for one cause or another the finer shades of
meaning escape too many teachers. Second, very few teachers
have received the necessary training to enable them to discern
quickly with what mental conditions various forms of vocal
expression are associated. In other words, they have not the
criteria of vocal expression; and, in consequence, helpful
criticism is impossible.</p>

<p>Why have previous methods of teaching reading practically
failed? There are three reasons: first, the lack of appreciation
of the best literature on the part of the teacher; second,
the complexity of vocal expression; and third, the intangibility
of vocal expression.</p>

<p>Appreciation of the meaning and beauty of literature is
the first requisite of a successful teacher of reading; and yet
there is little opportunity afforded the teacher to get this
appreciation. Is it not true that too many teachers have no
love for real literature? The fault is not theirs, but that of the
method of teaching literature that substitutes grammar, philology,
history, and lectures about literature for the study of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the meaning and beauty of the literature itself. One may
safely assert that thousands of children would be better readers,
even with the present faulty methods, if their teachers
had a genuine interest in the best literature. Of what avail is
it to put good literature into the schoolbooks if its merit does
not appeal as well to the instructor as to the pupil? The
stream can rise no higher than its source. There is, however,
a rapidly growing sentiment against the substitution of
parsing, history, philology, or ethics for genuine literary
training. We are coming to recognize that literature is art,
beauty, spirit; and, when this recognition becomes general,
we shall have better teachers and better readers. For there is
nothing that so stimulates our vocal expression as the desire to
impress upon others the beauty and feeling of what has
impressed ourselves.</p>

<p>Complexity may be defined by illustration. A phrase may
be read fast or slowly; in high or low key; with one melody
or another; with loud or subdued force; with this quality of
voice or with that. Now all these elements are present at one
time; so that, without proper training, the teacher is unable to
discriminate between them and hence unable to give the
needful correction, without which there can be no progress.</p>

<p>Intangibility may be explained by showing what is meant
by a tangible subject. The spelling lesson is tangible; the
arithmetic lesson is tangible. A mistake is easily recognized
and corrected. Three months after a paper on these subjects
has been handed in, the teacher can go back to it and examine
it. But vocal expression is evanescent, and, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
untrained, can be recalled imperfectly, if at all, and then only
a short time after it has been heard. In the presence of
the combined difficulties due to complexity and intangibility,
the teacher is appalled; and, conscientious though he be, he
gives up in despair. The teaching becomes perfunctory; the
children lose interest; and there is the end of reading. Reading,
which should be the brightest and most inspiring of
lessons, degenerates into a humdrum, dry-as-dust time-killer.
Good reading is as rare as the classical bird. No idea of a
pupil’s reading ability can be gained from a knowledge of the
class he is in. He is no better reader in the highest public-school
grade than he is in the grade two or three below the
highest. The teacher has come to recognize the futility of
his efforts; and so, in many class rooms, the time set apart for
reading is given up to language lessons, composition, and other
studies, valuable in themselves, but only incidentally helpful
in increasing the pupil’s reading power.</p>

<p>It may be asked, what objects are to be attained as a result
of reading lessons? There are two. First, to give us the
power to extract thought from the printed page. After we
leave school, our information is gained from books; and what
we get from these is largely determined by our school training.
Our system of education has a great deal to answer for when
it fails to provide this training. The value of vocal expression
is not to be depreciated, but of the utmost importance is
the ability to get the author’s meaning. Our teaching, from
the primary grade to the university, is lamentably weak in this
direction. A well-known college professor, in response to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
school superintendent’s question as to what would better the
preparation of secondary-school students for college, replied:
“For Heaven’s sake, teach them how to read.” Another
college instructor&mdash;a learned authority on geology&mdash;states
that he finds occasion to remark to his classes about once
a month, “It’s a great thing to be able to read a page of
English.” No one who examines the reading in our
schools can fail to be struck, not so much with the absence
of expressive power, as with the absence of mental grasp.
We are so anxious to get on that we are content with
skimming the surface, and do not take the time to get
beneath it. The reading lesson should be, primarily, a thinking
lesson, and every shade of thought should be carefully
determined, no matter how long a time may be consumed.
The habit of hurrying over the page, which is so prevalent,
is clearly an outgrowth of schoolroom methods. Careless
of all the future, we are too prone to push the pupil
along, ignoring the simplest and most evident of psychological
laws, that thought comes by thinking, and thinking
takes time.</p>

<p>One tires of the universal excuse for the laxity of our
methods: we have not the time. The reply to teacher, superintendent,
and school board is, we have no time to teach a subject
poorly. If thought-getting&mdash;genuine thought-getting&mdash;were
insisted on from the outset, without doubt the work which
now requires six or seven years to accomplish could be done in
five. How much thought power has the public-school graduate?
Very little. And yet, if all lessons&mdash;history, geography,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
arithmetic, and the rest&mdash;were made thought lessons, a child
of fourteen would be on the road to educating himself when
he left school. Is it not pitiful to see a bright boy or girl
spending three or four hours a day in the preparation of his
lessons, and then coming to class only to find that he has
wasted and worse than wasted his time? In taking leave of
this theme, the teacher is urged to ponder these noble words
of a noble man, “When thou readest, look steadfastly with
the mind at the things the words symbolize. If there be
question of mountains, let them loom before thee; if of the
ocean, let its billows roll before thy eyes. This habit will
give to thy voice even pliancy and meaning. The more
sources of interest we have, the richer is our life. To hold
any portion of truth in a vital way is better than to have its
whole baggage stored merely in one’s memory.” And,
again, “He who thinks for himself is rarely persuaded by
another. Information and inspiration he gladly receives,
but he forms his own judgment. Arguments and reasons
which, to the thoughtful, sound like mockery, satisfy the superficial
and ignorant.” And there is no better way to develop
such a thinking person than by careful training in reading.</p>

<p>Training in thought-getting is, then, the first result to be
expected from the reading lesson. The second is the power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of adequate vocal expression. The temptation to enlarge upon
the many benefits to body, voice, mind, and soul, to say
nothing of the practical worldly benefits of vocal expression, is
resisted. It is taken for granted that they are recognized; so
that we pass on to the discussion of a plan that may help us to
get these benefits; prefacing the discussion with the statement
that the evil results of our present laxity are not to be laid at
the door of the individual teacher, but at that of the educational
system in general.</p>

<p>This work makes no pretensions to treat in any detail
reading as an art. Its sole object is to present the ideal of
the reading lesson and suggest ways and means by which
that ideal may be brought somewhat nearer to our grasp than
it is at present. Nevertheless, to those who may desire to study
reading as an art, it can be safely said, that we must first be
good readers before we can be artists; and since this is so,
there should be much gain to them from a careful, definite
study of the fundamental principles herein set forth. For
special teachers of elocution, also, it is hoped that the book
may prove of some value, as dealing with those elements without
the understanding of which successful teaching of
advanced work is impossible.</p>

<p>Vocal culture, in the ordinary sense of the word, finds no
place in this discussion. The reason for this omission will
appear in the following pages. This much, however, may be
stated here; except under particularly favorable circumstances,
very little can be done in voice training in our public schools;
but by the plan herein presented, the voices of our children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
may be made truly expressive, and that, after all, is of more
value to them than mere technical facility.</p>

<p>While the subject of primary school reading is not discussed
directly, the primary teacher should derive considerable
assistance from the book, inasmuch as it aims to present the
standard of criticism and the psychology of reading. With
him rests to a great extent the success of any method of oral
expression. That he should have a clear conception of the
goal of the reading lessons and the manner of reaching it is
therefore beyond dispute.</p>

<p>The book has a double purpose. First, to assist the
teacher to teach reading; second, to help the teacher to
improve his own reading. The latter purpose explains the
amount of illustrative matter, and also the fact that some of
this is beyond the grasp of young and immature minds.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE CRITERION OF TIME</span></h3>


<p>It must be clear that no progress can be made in the
teaching of any subject unless the teacher possess a definite
standard of criticism; and, furthermore, it must be granted
that the teacher of reading does not possess this standard. We
have a standard in spelling, in arithmetic, in geography, but
none in reading&mdash;at least none clearly apprehended and scientifically
applied. It is, therefore, the purpose of the first part
of this book to present those elements of vocal expression&mdash;the
four criteria&mdash;a knowledge of which is indispensable to any
progress in the teaching of reading. These are, Time, Pitch,
Quality, and Force, the first of which we now proceed to
study in detail.</p>

<p>In Professor Raymond’s admirable work, <cite>The Orator’s
Manual</cite>, there appear these significant words: “The relative
time apportioned to a word indicates the <em>mind’s measurement</em>
of it,&mdash;represents the speaker’s judgment as to the amount of
meaning or importance that it conveys.” A moment’s
thought must convince us of the truth of this statement.
Making due allowance for certain speakers, who, for one
cause or another, have an unusually slow or fast utterance, the
principle laid down by Professor Raymond is, without doubt,
psychologically sound. In fact, it is a platitude; but like
many another platitude, its truth is so close to us that we fail
to perceive its meaning and application. An additional proof
of the soundness of this principle is found in music. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
solemn dirge, a funeral march, an anthem of praise is rendered
in slow time; while moderate and fast time seem the
fitting expression of the lighter moods.</p>

<p>Time, then, refers to the rate of vocal movement. It may
be fast, or moderate, or slow, according to the amount of what
may be called the collateral thinking accompanying the reading
of any given passage. To put it another way: a phrase
is read slowly because it means much; because the thought is
large, sublime, deep. The collateral thinking may be revealed
by an <em>expansive paraphrase</em>. For instance, in the lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,</p>
<p class="verse0">As his corse to the ramparts we hurried,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">why do we read slowly? The paraphrase answers the question.
It was midnight. There lay our beloved leader, who should
have been borne in triumphal procession to his last resting
place. Bells should have tolled, cannon thundered, and
thousands should have followed his bier. But now, alas! by
night, by stealth, without even a single drum tap, in fear and
dread, we crept breathless to the ramparts. This, or any
one of a hundred other paraphrases, will suffice to render the
vocal movement slow. And so it is with all slow time. Let it
be remembered that a profound or sublime thought <em>may</em> be
uttered in fast time; but that when we dwell upon that thought,
when we hold it before the mind, the time must necessarily be
slow.</p>

<p>The succeeding passages will have a prevailingly slow
movement. Measure the thought carefully, and think the
expansive paraphrase. These drills are not to train us to read
slowly (for any one can do that), but to think largely. The
movement will take care of itself. It is further urged that
the student give considerable attention to this part of the
subject; for the time so spent will be valuable not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
as it results in expressive movement, but because it is only
through meditation that the fullest insight into the meaning
of a passage can be acquired. Hence, dwelling for a long
period upon a phrase or sentence gives opportunity for the
enkindling of the imagination and emotion. It has been frequently
found that where a student’s movement was out of
harmony with the sentiment of the passage, his emotional
interpretation was equally poor. A farther careful study of the
text to improve the movement has generally resulted in the
improvement of the emotional expression.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker: The mingled tones of sorrow, like the voice of
many waters, have come unto us from a sister State&mdash;Massachusetts&mdash;weeping
for her honored son. The State I have the honor in
part to represent once endured, with yours, a common suffering,
battled for a common cause, and rejoiced in a common triumph.
Surely, then, it is meet that in this the day of your affliction we
should mingle our griefs.</p></div>

<p>Search creation round, where can you find a country that presents
so sublime a view, so interesting an anticipation? Who shall
say for what purpose mysterious Providence may not have designed
her! Who shall say that when in its follies or its crimes, the Old
World may have buried all the pride of its power, and all the
pomp of its civilization, human nature may not find its destined
renovation in the New! When its temples and its trophies shall
have mouldered into dust,&mdash;when the glories of its name shall be
but the legend of tradition, and the light of its achievements live
only in song, philosophy will revive again in the sky of her Franklin,
and glory rekindle at the urn of her Washington.</p></div>

<p>Often have I swept backward, in imagination, six thousand
years, and stood beside our great ancestor, as he gazed for the first
time upon the going down of the sun. What strange sensations
must have swept through his bewildered mind, as he watched the
last departing ray of the sinking orb, unconscious whether he
should ever behold its return.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wrapped in a maze of thought, strange and startling, he suffers
his eye to linger long about the point at which the sun has slowly
faded from view. A mysterious darkness creeps over the face of
Nature; the beautiful scenes of earth are slowly fading, one by one,
from his dimmed vision.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You think me a fanatic to-night, for you read history, not with
your eyes, but with your prejudices. But fifty years hence, when
Truth gets a hearing, the Muse of History will put Phocion for the
Greek, and Brutus for the Roman, Hampden for England, La Fayette
for France, choose Washington as the bright, consummate
flower of our earlier civilization, and John Brown as the ripe fruit
of our noonday, then, dipping her pen in the sunlight, will write
in the clear blue, above them all, the name of the soldier, the
statesman, the martyr, Toussaint L’Ouverture.</p></div>

<p>Figure to yourself a cataract like that of Niagara, poured in
foaming grandeur, not merely over one great precipice of two hundred
feet, but over the successive ridgy precipices of two or three
thousand, in the face of a mountain eleven thousand feet high, and
tumbling, crashing, thundering down with a continuous din of far
greater sublimity than the sound of the grandest cataract. The
roar of the falling mass begins to be heard the moment it is loosened
from the mountain; it pours on with the sound of a vast body of
rushing water; then comes the first great concussion, a booming
crash of thunders, breaking on the still air in mid-heaven; your
breath is suspended, and you listen and look; the mighty glittering
mass shoots headlong over the main precipice, and the fall is so
great that it produces to the eye that impression of dread majestic
slowness of which I have spoken, though it is doubtless more rapid
than Niagara. But if you should see the cataract of Niagara itself
coming down five thousand feet above you in the air, there would
be the same impression. The image remains in the mind, and can
never fade from it; it is as if you had seen an alabaster cataract
from heaven. The sound is far more sublime than that of Niagara,
because of the preceding stillness in those Alpine solitudes. In the
midst of such silence and solemnity, from out the bosom of those
glorious, glittering forms of nature, comes that rushing, crashing
thunder-burst of sound! If it were not that your soul, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
eye, is as filled and fixed with the sublimity of the vision as,
through the sense of hearing, with that of the audible report,
methinks you would wish to bury your face in your hands, and fall
prostrate, as at the voice of the Eternal.</p></div>

<p>The following will illustrate fast movement. Let there be
no attempt to accelerate the speed, but let the thought and
emotion themselves govern that. No examples are given to
illustrate moderate time, since the student gets sufficient

thought. Without attempting to force any interpretation

may note how the relative importance of the ideas affects the
rate of movement in the various phrases.</p>

<p class="p1" />

<p>It must be evident that it is very difficult to suggest by a
word the rate of speed at which one should render a given line.
Fast and slow are relative terms. Certain speakers would
consider slow reading what another would consider moderate.
Yet there is on the whole a pretty general agreement as to the
use of these terms. With this statement, we may proceed to
an analysis of the selection to justify the marking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The citizens of Rome have just declared to the tribunes,
enemies of Caesar, why the people are making holiday: “We
make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph.”
Whereupon Marullus, one of the tribunes, begins his speech,
endeavoring to convince the mob that there is absolutely
nothing Caesar has done to merit this ovation. After the
word “tributaries,” the time is accelerated for the reason that
all that follows, to the end of the query, is virtually repetitious,
being included in the idea of tributaries. The indicated
marking of lines four and five needs no justification. “Knew
you not Pompey?” is a question containing reproach. The
latter element will tend to retard the movement. “Many a
time and oft” is repetitious; he is simply reminding them of
well-known facts. When the speaker reaches “yea, to
chimney-tops,” the importance of the idea is at once manifest
in the slower time, which continues to “arms,” when it again
changes to medium and fast. The student may find it a good
drill to examine the remaining lines, to see whether he agrees
with or differs from the time-markings.</p>

<p>Thus far we have been considering the element of time
without regard to details. It is now necessary to note that
time may be affected in two ways: by quantity and by pause.
By dwelling upon the words the time may be retarded, and
the same effect may be produced by frequent or long pauses.
In the former instance, the mind is dwelling upon the thought
while the voice is giving it expression; and in the latter, the
mind is dwelling upon the idea or the collateral thought
between the words or groups. The two methods may be
illustrated in the following extract: “Our Father, which
art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.” One may read
this with but one pause, after “Heaven”; or he may appropriately
pause after “Father,” “Heaven,” and “hallowed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<h4>GROUPING</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following extract, and then read it
aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">But when the gray dawn stole into his tent,</p>
<p class="verse0">He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">And took his horseman’s cloak, and left his tent,</p>
<p class="verse0">And went abroad into the cold wet fog,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa’s tent.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We notice a tendency to break up the sentence into groups
of varying length. This tendency is more or less instinctive;
and while there may be some difference of opinion as to the
number of groups, yet it must be conceded that there is a
definite underlying principle, which admits of no exception.
For instance, one might read the fourth line as if it were but
one group; another, with virtually the same idea in mind,
might divide it into two groups at the word “abroad.” On
the other hand, no one would read in this way: “And went
abroad into the”&mdash;“cold wet fog through”&mdash;“the dim camp to
Peran-Wisa’s tent.”</p>

<p>Read the following sentences aloud carefully, and it will
be noticed that the same principle of grouping obtains:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The star of Napoleon was just rising to its zenith as that of
Washington was passing away.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The name and memory of Washington will travel with the
Silver Queen of Heaven through sixty degrees of longitude, nor
part company with her till she walks in her brightness through the
Golden Gate of California, and passes serenely on to hold midnight
court with her Australian Stars.</p></div>

<p>The reading of these illustrations shows that grouping is
entirely independent of punctuation. It is true that the spoken
group may coincide with the grammatical group, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is merely an accident. We group as we do, not because of
punctuation marks, but for more fundamental and less conventional
reasons. The function of the punctuation mark is
to assist the reader in getting the author’s thought. The
following example will illustrate this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The slaves who were in the hold of the vessel had been captured
in Africa.</p></div>

<p>It is plain that the clause introduced by “who” is a
restrictive one, and implies that there were other slaves on the
vessel besides those mentioned. If we now insert commas
after “slaves” and “vessel,” the sentence becomes equivalent
to, The slaves, and they were all in the hold of the vessel, had
been captured in Africa.</p>

<p>Note, again, how the sense would be obscured if the author
had omitted the comma after “all” in this extract:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">We are not like swimmers in the sea, but poised on the
top of a huge wave of fate, as swimmers in the sea are poised
on waves of water.</p>

<p>To prove that grouping is independent of punctuation, let
the student read aloud the following illustrations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">But, look you, Cassius,</p>
<p class="verse0">The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; and, as I told you, he
put it by once; but, for all that, to my thinking he would have
had it ... and, for mine own part, I dare not laugh.</p></div>

<p>In the two preceding extracts, the reader would hardly
pause after “But,” “you,” and the “and’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>While we are on the subject of punctuation, it may be
advisable to look at a few examples in which the understanding
of the force of punctuation vitally affects the reading. In
these lines from Tennyson’s <cite>Ode on the Death of the Duke
of Wellington</cite>, students carelessly connect the phrase “sad
and slow” with “Lead out the pageant.” As a matter of
fact, a moment’s thought must show us that the opening
sentence is complete in itself, and that “sad and slow” modifies
“go.” A careful reading of the text would reveal this,
but a mind that had been trained to observe these matters of
punctuation would have observed at once that the colon separated
the two ideas, and, further, that the word modified by
“sad and slow” was to be sought further on. Here is the
passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Lead out the pageant: sad and slow,</p>
<p class="verse0">As fits a universal woe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Let the long long procession go,</p>
<p class="verse0">And let the sorrowing crowd about it grow,</p>
<p class="verse0">And let the mournful martial music flow,</p>
<p class="verse0">The last great Englishman is low.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another passage, from <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, is equally
interesting and instructive. Shylock says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yet his means are in supposition; he hath an argosy bound to
Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the
Rialto, he hath a third to Mexico, a fourth for England; and other
ventures he hath, squandered abroad.</p></div>

<p>Seven students out of ten read the last sentence as if “hath
squandered” were the verb. The comma after “hath” shows
this to be a mistake, and, moreover, denotes a shade of meaning
that is very significant of Shylock’s character.</p>

<p>The object in giving these illustrations has been to free
the student from a very common misconception that the group<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is determined by the punctuation mark, and, further, to draw
his attention to the necessity of scanning the punctuation with
the utmost care. As a rule, the words are in themselves
sufficient index of the author’s meaning; but, as in the cases
cited, there are times when carelessness regarding punctuation
leads to serious and ridiculous misunderstanding. The
punctuation will make the sense clear wherever such help is
necessary; but after that, as far as grouping is concerned, the
student need give it no further attention. In order to impress
the fact that grouping and punctuation are independent of
each other, the following examples should be thoughtfully
considered and then read aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">So every bondman in his own hand bears</p>
<p class="verse0">The power to cancel his captivity.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1" />
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2">And as the greatest only are,</p>
<p class="verse0">In his simplicity sublime.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note that “only” modifies “greatest,” and hence should
be separated from “are.” If the sentence were prose, it
would read, “And as only the greatest are,” in which case
there would be no difficulty in the reading. As it is, we must
bring out the relation by careful grouping.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first object of a free people is the preservation of their
liberty; and liberty is only to be preserved by maintaining constitutional
restraints and just divisions of political power.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soon after William H. Harrison’s nomination, a writer in one of
the leading administration papers spoke of his “log cabin” and his
use of “hard cider,” by way of sneer and reproach....</p>

<p>It did not happen to me to be born in a log cabin, but my elder
brothers and sisters were born in a log cabin, raised amid the
snowdrifts of New Hampshire, at a period so early that, when the
smoke rose from its rude chimney and curled over the frozen hills,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
there was no similar evidence of a white man’s habitation between
it and the settlements on the rivers of Canada.</p></div>

<p>The following example is an excellent one to illustrate the
necessity of paying careful attention to grouping:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Of Man’s first disobedience, and the fruit</p>
<p class="verse0">Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</p>
<p class="verse0">Brought death into the world, and all our woe,</p>
<p class="verse0">With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</p>
<p class="verse0">Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sing, Heavenly Muse, that on the secret top</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire</p>
<p class="verse0">That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed,</p>
<p class="verse0">In the beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth</p>
<p class="verse0">Rose out of Chaos.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is to be remarked that the spirit did not teach the shepherd
“in the beginning,” but “how the Heav’ns and Earth
rose” in the beginning, “out of Chaos.” If we turn this
last sentence into prose, it will assist us in getting the poet’s
meaning and consequently in giving the correct rendition.</p>


<h4>THE PAUSE AS AN EXPRESSIVE ELEMENT</h4>

<p>In the study of grouping, the student noticed that the
groups were separated by pauses of varying duration. It may
be said that the pauses were the results of the grouping rather
than that the grouping was the result of the pauses. In other
words, the pause could hardly be called expressive.</p>

<p>We are now to study the pause as an expressive element.
No definite rule can be laid down for pausing; that is determined,
to a large extent, by the temperament, the nature of the
thought, and the occasion. It must be borne in mind, however,
that the pause is not mere silence. A very little observation
will show us that while the voice ceases, the thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
continues to manifest itself in pantomimic expression. What
is it, then, that determines the pause? The answer has a
twofold aspect. First, pausing is an instinctive process, and
comes as the result of certain psychological processes. We
think in ideas, not in individual words, and these ideas are
separated in our minds by pauses of varying length. We do
not stop to consider whether or no we shall pause between the
phrases of a sentence; the pause, as has been stated, comes
instinctively, and is a manifestation of psycho-psychological
action. In the second place, the pause is made as the result,
to a greater or less degree, of collateral thinking. In other
words, any given idea may call up another train of thought,
with which the mind may engage itself, and such engagement
would find actual expression in the pause. It must be
remembered that the collateral thinking may take the mind
backward or forward. According to the amount of this collateral
thinking will be the duration of the pause.</p>

<p>An extract from the play of <cite>Julius Caesar</cite> will illustrate
this point. In the fifth act, Brutus and Cassius have taken
their “everlasting farewell,” and Brutus ends the interview
with these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Why then, lead on.&mdash;O, that a man might know</p>
<p class="verse0">The end of this day’s business, ere it come!</p>
<p class="verse0">But it sufficeth, that the day will end,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then the end is known.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The first four words of this speech are addressed to the
onlookers. The word “on” takes the mind of the thoughtful
and considerate leader to the battlefield where the fate of
Rome is to be decided. He perceives that the future of his
beloved city hangs trembling in the balance. The appearance
on the preceding night of the ghost of Caesar, warning him
that it will see him at Philippi, fills Brutus with apprehension.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
And then, how many of his followers, now so ready to do battle
under his standard, will, ere night, lie cold in death upon
the bloody field! All this and more passes through his
mind, and his solicitude and apprehension manifest themselves
in his features and in his body. Then even the stoical Brutus
cannot repress his anxiety, which we note in the words, “O,
that a man might know.” This extract, therefore, well illustrates
what was said above,&mdash;that the pause, as we here consider
it, is not mere silence, but cessation of voice while the
expression continues in the body. In the second place, it is
plain that the collateral thinking determines the length of the
pause.</p>

<p>Another element that determines the duration of the pause
is the distance apart of the thoughts separated by the pause.
Let us illustrate this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If this law were put upon our statute books there would not
be, five years from to-day, a dissenting voice raised against it from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Let it not be understood that there are no occasions when the
phrase “from the Atlantic to the Pacific” would not be uttered
with scarcely any pause after Atlantic. This phrase, and
others like it, may have become a mere commonplace to
describe extent; but in such a passage as the above, where the
speaker is hyperbolically expressive, he no doubt intends to
convey the idea that not one objection would be heard even in
all the three thousand miles between the oceans. If the student
will stop for a moment to analyze his own consciousness
while uttering this sentence, he will scarcely fail to see the
vast extent of territory separating the two oceans.</p>

<p>Many writers on the subject have given emotion as a
reason for the pause. Strictly speaking, however, emotion,
as distinct from thinking, seldom or never is the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
pause, unless it completely choke the utterance. In the
example quoted above from <cite>Julius Caesar</cite> there is no doubt
considerable emotion during the pause; but it is the thought,
and not the emotion arising out of it, that leads to the silence.</p>

<p>The following excerpt is from the speech of Satan in
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. Satan has been cursing his lot and the
author of his punishment. Finally, his judgment tells him
that he himself, and not God, is responsible for the downfall.
The pauses, indicated by the vertical lines, are suggestive of
the proper rendition. Of course, the pauses vary in duration
from the briefest cessation of voice to pauses of considerable
length:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Nay, | curs’d be thou; | since against his | thy will</p>
<p class="verse0">Chose freely | what it now | so justly rues.</p>
<p class="verse0">Me | miserable! which way shall I fly</p>
<p class="verse0">Infinite wrath, | and infinite despair? |</p>
<p class="verse0">Which way I fly | is Hell; | myself | am Hell;</p>
<p class="verse0">And in the lowest deep | a lower deep |</p>
<p class="verse0">Still threat’ning to devour me | opens wide |</p>
<p class="verse0">To which the Hell I suffer | seems a Heav’n.</p>
<p class="verse0">But say I could repent | and could obtain |</p>
<p class="verse0">By act of grace | my former state, | how soon</p>
<p class="verse0">Would height | recall high thoughts, | how soon unsay |</p>
<p class="verse0">What feign’d submission | swore.</p>
<p class="verse0">This | knows my punisher; therefore | as far</p>
<p class="verse0">From granting | he, as I | from begging | peace.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The student should practice the following examples until he
perceives clearly the force of the preceding principles. The
group is the thought unit, and the proper rendition of the
sentence depends upon our grasp of the units that compose it.
Hence, a conscientious study of the phrasing will lead not
only to careful grouping, but to a grasp of the thought in its
entirety that cannot fail to affect for good the reading of the
whole selection:</p>

<p>Some of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me
very much in what I have heard or seen here and elsewhere. I

Do you know that in the gradual passage from maturity to helplessness
the harshest characters sometimes have a period in which
they are gentle and placid as young children? I have heard it said,
but I cannot be sponsor for its truth, that the famous chieftain,
Lochiel, was rocked in a cradle like a baby, in his old age. An old
man, whose studies had been of the severest scholastic kind, used to
love to hear little nursery stories read over and over to him.
One who saw the Duke of Wellington in his last years describes

<p>At the moment when death so suddenly stayed his course the
greatness of Henry the Fifth had reached its highest point. He
had won the Church by his orthodoxy, the nobles by his warlike
prowess, the whole people by his revival of the glories of Crecy and
Poitiers. In France his cool policy had transformed him from a
foreign conqueror into a legal heir to the crown; his title of
Regent and of successor to the throne rested on the formal recognition
of the estates of the realm; and his progress to the very
moment of his death promised a speedy mastery of the whole
country. But the glory of Agincourt and the genius of Henry the
Fifth hardly veiled at the close of his reign the weakness and humiliation
of the Crown when the succession passed to his infant son.</p></div>


<h4>PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS</h4>

<p>From what has been stated, it must be clear that drills in
fast time or slow time are useless and fraught with much
danger of affectation. Any of us can read slowly or rapidly;
that is merely a matter of mechanics. The object to be
attained is the development of such power of discrimination
in the child that the value of each phrase and sentence shall
be carefully determined; and then the degree of extent, depth,
sublimity or grandeur of the thought will determine the rate
of movement. Training in Time for its own sake is valueless.
From the very beginning, the teacher must use Time as a test,
as a standard of criticism; and all corrections must be made
with a clear perception on the part of the teacher of the
psychology of Time. If a child read too rapidly, it is because
his mind is not sufficiently occupied with the thought; if he
read too slowly, it is because he does not get the words; or
because he is temperamentally slow; or because, and this is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
most likely explanation, he is making too much of a small
idea.</p>

<p>The only excuse for drills in Time is when a pupil reads
everything at about the same rate. In such a case, in the
upper grades, the teacher may choose certain selections for the
proper expression of which approximately fast or slow movement,
as the case may be, would be required. Then let the
teacher, through careful analysis and question, lead the child to
understand the passages as the teacher understands them, and
the proper rate of utterance will follow. This process may seem
slow; but let us bear in mind that we are dealing with fundamental
principles of thinking, and too much time cannot be
spent in building our foundations strong and solid. Furthermore,
if the rate of utterance is not the instinctive manifestation
of the child’s thought measurement, it is nothing at all.
To tell him to read fast or slowly is but to make him affected,
and incidentally, even if unconsciously, to impress upon him
that reading is a matter of mechanics and not of thought-getting
and thought-giving.</p>

<p>In order to teach grouping, various rules have been laid
down. Pupils have committed a long list of these without
much practical benefit. A few of these rules are given to show
the mechanical nature of such a method of teaching. “In
every direct period, the principal pause comes at that part
where the sense begins to form, or the expectation excited by
the first member begins to be answered.” Or, “A loose sentence
requires a longer pause between its first member (usually
a period direct or inverted), and the additional member which
does not modify it.” And, again, “Where the adjective
follows the substantive or noun it modifies, and has modifiers
of its own, constituting a descriptive phrase, it should be
separated from its noun by a short pause.” Now, it may be
quite true that these rules are valid, but is it not clear that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pedagogy which makes use of them in the earlier stages approaches
the subject from the wrong side? It lays stress upon
the objective rather than upon the subjective aspect.</p>

<p>The pause should never be taught merely as pause. If the
principles herein discussed have any meaning, they must
surely teach us that the pause must come spontaneously.
The pedagogic point to be remembered is that the pupil must
be trained to extract the thought piece by piece, and to
express it. The pause will then appear without consciousness.
The attempt to teach pauses as such must result in
mechanical silences, during which the face of the pupil
is a perfect blank, the indubitable sign of mental blankness.</p>

<p>It should certainly now be clear that it is wrong to
draw the attention of the pupil to the pause as such, and
that it is useless and often misleading to give him at the
beginning rules of pausing. We must approach the printed
page in the spirit with which we approach one who is speaking
to us, and, having grasped the meaning, repeat the ideas.
Then the pauses will come as the unconscious expression of
certain definite mental action.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no better way of bringing home to the
reader the psychological action lying behind grouping and
pausing than by calling his attention to a chapter from a brief
but most attractive work by Ernest Legouvé, of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conservatoire
Française</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To conclude what we have to say on the first portion of our subject,
the material part of reading, we must now occupy ourselves a
little with what may be called punctuation.</p>

<p>The tongue punctuates as well as the pen.</p>

<p>One day, Samson, sitting at his desk, sees himself approached by
a young man apparently pretty well satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>“You wish to take reading lessons, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur Samson.”</p>

<p>“Have you had some practice in reading aloud?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“O yes, Monsieur Samson, I have often recited whole passages
from Corneille and Molière.”</p>

<p>“In public?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur Samson.”</p>

<p>“With success?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, Monsieur, I think I may flatter myself that far.”</p>

<p>“Take up that book, please. It is Fontaine’s Fables. Open it
at the <cite>Oak and the Reed</cite>. Let me hear you read a line or two.”</p>

<p>The pupil begins:</p>

<p>“The Oak one day, said to the Reed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, sir! You don’t know anything about reading!”</p>

<p>“It is because I don’t know much, Monsieur Samson,” replies
the pupil, a little nettled, “it is precisely because I don’t know
much that I’ve come to you for lessons. But I don’t exactly comprehend
how from my manner of reading a single verse&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Read the line again, sir.”</p>

<p>He reads it again:</p>

<p>“The Oak one day, said to the Reed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There! You can’t read! I told you so!”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But,” interrupts Samson, cold and dry, “but why do you
join the adverb to the noun rather than to the verb? What kind
of an Oak is an Oak one day? No kind at all! There is no such
tree! Why, then, do you say: <em>the Oak one day, said to the Reed</em>?
This is the way it should go: <em>the Oak (comma) one day said to the
Reed</em>. You understand, of course?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do,” replies the other, a new light breaking on
him. “It seems as if there should be an invisible comma after Oak!”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir,” continues the master. “Every passage
has a double set of punctuation marks, one visible, the other
invisible; one is the printer’s work, the other the reader’s.”</p>

<p>“The reader’s? Does the reader also punctuate?”</p>

<p>“Certainly he does, quite independently too of the printer’s
points, though it must be acknowledged that sometimes both coincide.
By a certain cadenced silence the reader marks his period;
by a half silence, his comma; by a certain accent, an interrogation;
by a certain tone, an exclamation. And I must assure you
that it is exclusively on the skillful distribution of these insensible
points that not only the interest of the story, but actually its
clearness, its comprehensibility, altogether depends.”</p></div>

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<span class="fs60">THE CRITERION OF PITCH</span></h3>


<p>The second criterion is that of Pitch. By Pitch is meant
everything that has to do with the acuteness or gravity of the
tone,&mdash;in other words, with keys, melodies, inflections and
modulations. Again we are indebted to Professor Raymond
for a clear statement regarding this most subtle of all the
elements of expression. His words are as follows: “The
melody of the movement taken by the voice represents, therefore,
like the melody in music, the <em>mind’s motive</em>,&mdash;indicates
its purpose in using the particular phraseology to which the
melody is applied; and because pitch, through the kinds of
inflections and melody chosen, reveals the motives, we shall
find that the use of this element in ordinary conversation is
constantly causing precisely the same phraseology to express
entirely opposite meanings.” Before proceeding further,
it may be well to illustrate this principle, in order that the
reader may follow more clearly the subsequent discussion.</p>

<p>Let us suppose some one to ask the question, “Do you
think Mr. Jones is a good teacher?” and that the reply is
given, “Oh, yes,” with a melody that virtually says, “Oh, I
suppose so; he is not a very great teacher; in fact, there are
many things about his teaching that might be a great deal
better, but he manages to get along.” Now, all of this paraphrase,
which reveals the motive, is manifested in the significant
melody upon the two words, “Oh, yes.” Let us suppose
further that a few days later Mr. Jones comes to us and calls
us to account for speaking disparagingly of his teaching.
“What,” we reply, “we say anything against your teaching!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Why, when Smith asked us whether we considered you a
good teacher, we said in the most unequivocal manner, ‘Oh,
yes’!” And this time we utter the words with strong, positive
assertiveness. The words in both cases are the same, but
the different melodies indicate entirely opposite motives behind
the words.</p>

<p>Read aloud such a sentence as, “John rode to the park last
Christmas,” changing the meaning by transferring the significant
inflection successively to all the important words, thus:</p>

<p><em>John</em> rode to the park last Christmas.</p>

<p>John <em>rode</em> to the park last Christmas.</p>

<p>John rode to the <em>park</em> last Christmas, etc.</p>

<p>Does it not appear that, with each change in the motive,
the melody changes?</p>

<p>We often hear it said that in such cases as the last we have
been changing the emphasis. This is true. But emphasis is
a broad term, and one often confused with force. As a matter
of fact, the changes in the successive readings were changes of
melody due in every case to changes of motive.</p>

<p>Again, “When we are in our graves our children will honor
it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivities,
with bonfires, with joy.” The inflections on the last four
nouns would probably be falling. Why? Because each would
be held to be of sufficient importance to be emphasized by
itself, and cut off from the others. To read them with rising
inflections would be to manifest the fact that the mind was
thinking of them in the aggregate. Once again, the melody
shows the motive.</p>

<p>The melody is an indubitable sign of the discriminative
ability of the reader. It is the severest test of his power to
perceive sense, or logical, relations. So important a feature
of the work is this that it appears necessary to emphasize it
and to illustrate it in many ways.</p>

<p class="verse0">But life itself, my wife, and all the world,</p>
<p class="verse0">Are not with me esteem’d above thy life:</p>
<p class="verse0">I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all</p>
<p class="verse0">Here to this devil, to deliver you.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is evident that he does not wish to assert that he is married,
nor that he is married to a wife; but that he is married
to a wife as dear as life itself. And yet many a pupil reads the
passage as if Bassanio were desirous of insisting upon the fact
that he is married to a wife. Not a very remarkable condition
of affairs, truly. It is no argument to say that the
comma after “wife” indicates the necessity of a rising inflection
on that word. As has been already intimated, and as will
be later developed, the punctuation has nothing to do with
the inflection.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sullen and silent and disconsolate.</p>
<p class="verse0">Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,</p>
<p class="verse0">With look bewildered, and a vacant stare,</p>
<p class="verse0">Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,</p>
<p class="verse0">By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,</p>
<p class="verse0">His only friend the ape, his only food</p>
<p class="verse0">What others left,&mdash;he still was unsubdued.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the preceding passage, note that from the third line to
the clause at the end of the sentence the mind is glancing forward,
and this fact will be evident in the rising inflection at
the end of every important statement. Notice, further, that
all of these statements will be uttered in what is virtually the
same melody. The reason for this is that they are co-ordinate,
and having the same motive behind them will be read
with the same melody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe the different melodies in the following sentences,
and how the difference manifests the varying motive:</p>

<p>When Mark Antony uses the phrase, “honorable men,” in
the beginning of his oration, there can be no doubt that he
avoids even the slightest indication of sarcasm in his voice.
Whatever his ultimate purpose may be, his immediate intention
is to conciliate the mob. This purpose, his motive, is
shown by the unequivocal melody with which he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">For Brutus is an honorable man,</p>
<p class="verse0">So are they all, all honorable men,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Come I to speak on Caesar’s funeral.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to consider this aspect farther. Let
us, however, examine the subject in detail. The first consideration
is that of Key. Key has been defined as “the fundamental
tone of a movement to which its modulations are referred, and
with which it generally begins and ends; keynote.” (Webster.)
Perhaps the meaning of the current phrases “high key” and
“low key” will make the definition clear. When we say of
one that he speaks in a high key, we should be understood as
meaning that his pitch is prevailingly high; and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
reverse is true when we say of one that he speaks in a low
key. While it is true that the key differs in individuals, yet
experience shows that within a note or two we all use the same
keys in expressing the same states of minds. The question
for us is, What determines the key? It can be set down as a
fixed principle that controlled mental states are expressed in
the low keys, while the high keys are the manifestation of
the less controlled mental conditions.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This principle will be
more readily understood when we consider the states finding
expression in low or high key in music. We should hardly
awaken much enthusiasm by playing <em>Yankee Doodle</em> in a
key an octave below that in which it is written; nor should
we catch the subtle meaning of Chopin’s <cite>Funeral March</cite> if
it were played in a key an octave higher than the original key.
Let the reader study the spirit of the following extracts, and
read them aloud. He will find in such practice the best proof
of the truth of the principle we are here discussing:</p>

<p>The reason for low pitch or high pitch is psycho-physiological.
Nerve tension means muscular tension, and, since the
muscles controlling the vocal chords are subject to the same
laws as the other muscles, the greater the tension the
higher the pitch. Hence, since what we have called the controlled
states are accompanied by relatively low muscular tension,
it necessarily follows that they will be expressed in
relatively low keys.</p>

<p>The desire to communicate thought to another has a
tendency to raise the key. To illustrate: if we are addressing
an audience in a small room, we shall speak in a moderately
low key. If the auditorium is large, the key will be higher.
If we are speaking in the open air, the chances are that we
shall use a key considerably above that of ordinary conversation.
On the other hand, when one is communing with
himself, the absence of desire to reach others removes the
tension, and in consequence the pitch is low. It is well to
bear in mind that all soliloquies are not read in low key.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Soliloquies are often full of uncontrolled passion, in which
case the principle first laid down would apply, and the pitch
would be high, according to the degree of tension. What has
been said in this paragraph we may sum up in a few words:
those states in which there is strong desire to communicate
(objective states) are manifested in high key; while the
introspective (subjective) states find expression in the lower
keys. Henry V., inciting his soldiers to attack the enemy’s
fortifications, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;</p>
<p class="verse0">Or close the wall up with our English dead!</p>
<p class="verse0">In peace, there’s nothing so becomes a man,</p>
<p class="verse0">As modest stillness, and humility:</p>
<p class="verse0">But when the blast of war blows in our ears,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then imitate the action of the tiger;</p>
<p class="verse0">Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,</p>
<p class="verse0">Disguise fair nature with hard-favor’d rage:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;</p>
<p class="verse0">Let it pry through the portage of the head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it,</p>
<p class="verse0">As fearfully as doth a gallèd rock</p>
<p class="verse0">O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,</p>
<p class="verse0">Swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean.</p>
<p class="verse0">Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide;</p>

<p>The tension of the speaker is evidently high, owing to the
exhilaration of the moment, and to the desire to project his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
voice (of which he may be unconscious), and consequently the
key will be high. It is the joy of the English people that
Tennyson voices in his Welcome to Alexandra. Again the
key is relatively high.</p>

<p>Hamlet’s soliloquy will find expression in moderately low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

upon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse0">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p class="verse0">And by opposing end them? To die,&mdash;to sleep,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p class="verse0">The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p class="verse0">That flesh is heir to,&mdash;’tis a consummation</p>
<p class="verse0">Devoutly to be wish’d. To die,&mdash;to sleep;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">To sleep! perchance to dream!&mdash;ay, there’s the rub;</p>
<p class="verse0">For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p>
<p class="verse0">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p class="verse0">Must give us pause: there’s the respect</p>
<p class="verse0">That makes calamity of so long life;</p>
<p class="verse0">For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p class="verse0">Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p>
<p class="verse0">The pangs of disprized love, the law’s delay,</p>
<p class="verse0">The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p class="verse0">That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</p>
<p class="verse0">When he himself might his quietus made</p>

<p>The following lines are delivered by Hamlet when he
appreciates the fact that while his father’s blood cries out for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
vengeance he stands idle, beset by doubts and fears. The
speech is a soliloquy, but it would be rendered in a moderately
high pitch owing to the mental tension of the speaker:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
<p class="verse0">Is it not monstrous, that this player here,</p>

<p class="verse0">That from her working all his visage wann’d;</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The principle just discussed,&mdash;that key depends on the
degree of tension, first mental, then physical,&mdash;is of very wide
application. As a matter of fact, it explains the whole subject
of melody. In passing from a controlled to a less controlled
state, the voice rises, and vice versa. To illustrate:
Brutus says to Cassius, “You yourself are much condemned
to have an itching palm”; and Cassius replies, “I an itching
palm!” On the word “I” the voice of Cassius strikes upward
through, perhaps, an octave of the scale, and this inflection
manifests the increasing tension of Cassius’ mind as he utters
the exclamation. It is almost impossible to restrain the tension
of throat and hand while reading the passage. Note how the
muscular tension increases while one is speaking the words of
Cassius. Bearing in mind what has been said of the relation
of bodily tension to pitch, the explanation of Cassius’ inflection
will not be far to seek. Again, Brutus says, “The name
of Cassius honors this corruption, and chastisement doth
therefore hide his head.” Cassius replies in one word,
“Chastisement.” There are two interpretations of this
word: one, that Cassius replies, as if questioning, “Do you
dare say this to me?” and the other, that, astounded at the
bluntness of Brutus’s speech, Cassius replies, speaking to himself,
“He dared speak of chastisement to me!” In the first
case the inflection would be rising, denoting the increase of
tension; in the second case, the inflection would be falling,
marking a gradual decrease of tension. Let the reader
experiment on this example, and observe how the mental tension
corresponds with the physical tension.</p>

<p>The melody in which any phrase or sentence is given
consists of a series of waves, the crests of which mark the
maximum of tension. It is a difficult matter to indicate
speech melody, but it is hoped the following illustrations will
be at least sufficiently suggestive to make clear the psychology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of melody. In the following sentence there is a gradual
ascent of the voice, since the intensity increases from the first
word to the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_055a.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Came I not forth upon thy pledge my father’s hand to kiss?</p>
</div></div>

<p>Again, we have a very similar melody in this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Would you wrest the wreath of fame</p>
<p class="verse0">From the hand of fate?</p>
</div></div>

<p>The descending melody, denoting that the maximum of tension
is at the beginning of the sentence, is found in the following:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_055b.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>All gloom, all silence, all despair!</p>

<p>“Dead” marks the crest of the wave of tension in the
following. Observe how the melody rises to that word and
descends after it:</p>

<p>For those who have no musical ear, it may be somewhat
difficult to catch these speech melodies. But, fortunately, in
most cases, an acute musical ear is not necessary. Melody
takes care of itself. When we have determined the principal
word in each phrase, the melody will rise or fall from that
without any effort on our part. And furthermore, even those
without an ear for tune recognize instinctively the appropriateness
of a given melody which they may be unable to analyze in
detail. Nevertheless, the ability to analyze speech tunes is a
great aid to the teacher; and it is to be hoped that the foregoing
explanation will materially assist him in his work of
developing the logical acumen of his class.</p>

<p>Melody is made up of skips and inflections. The inflection
needs no definition; the skip is simply a discreet passage from
one note to another. As the violinist draws his bow over the
string and simultaneously runs his finger up or down the
string, we have the analogy of the inflection. The pianist
cannot do more than skip from one note to another, although
there is an approximation to the glide, or inflection, in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">legato</i>
playing. The skip is found in such a sentence as this:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Give Brutus a statue with his ancestors?
</div></div>

<p>The psychology of the skip is precisely that of the inflection,
i. e., transition from less to more tension, or the reverse.
In such an exclamation as, “Thou tattered upstart!” it is
next to impossible to use the wide rising inflection that would
be natural on the first syllable of “upstart,” owing to the
nature of the syllable. Hence, there would be a skip between
“up” and “start.” But let it be carefully observed
that, including the skip, the voice traverses exactly the interval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it would have passed through had it been possible to
use one inflection, as, for instance, on “boy” in “Thou tattered
boy!” Our attention may now be turned to inflections.</p>

<p>Inflections are not a matter of accident, nor are they a
conventional device. Their meaning is definite and fixed,
and their force instinctively recognized by all. Although we
do not stop to analyze them, they convey to all alike a distinct
shade of thought. And further, the same shade of thought
will always find expression through the same inflections. We
must bear in mind that it is not claimed that all will be moved
in the same way by the same stimulus, nor that all will take
the same meaning from a given passage. What is claimed is,
that the same purpose will find expression, with all, in fundamentally
the same melody (of which inflections form the
larger part). If this were not so, how should we understand
one another? We discern a speaker’s purpose quite as much
in his melody as in his words. For example, if one were to ask,
“Are you going out?” with the object of acquiring information,
he would use instinctively a rising inflection on “out.”
If he were surprised at our intention to go out, he would use a
wider rising inflection. And if he had asked the question
several times without receiving a reply, and were now insisting
on an answer (his motive now being to assert his right to an
answer) he would use a wide downward inflection on “out.”
And so should we all under like conditions, and the meaning
of all would be alike understood by all. We need enlarge no
further on this. Let it suffice that if given inflections had
not always the same meaning and were not always instinctively
used to express the same purpose, conversation would be
impossible.</p>

<p>The rising inflection is the sign of incomplete sense.
Whenever the mind points forward the significant inflection is
upward. Test this in the following illustrations. The rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
inflection will be particularly noticed on the italicized words,
which are not necessarily to be strongly emphasized:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <em>1815</em> M. Charles <em>Myriel</em> was the bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;. He was a

D&mdash;&mdash; since 1806. Although the following details in no way
affect our <em>narrative</em>, it may not be useless to quote the rumors that
were current about <em>him</em> at the moment when he came to the
diocese; for what is said of <em>men</em>, whether it be true or <em>false</em>, often

<p>When, for any reason, we do not desire to assert strongly;
when what we have to say is trite, trivial, repetitious; when
we are uncertain or doubtful; when we entreat; when we ask
a question to which the answer yes or no is expected, we also
use the rising inflection.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to confuse this form of interrogation
with Figurative Interrogation. The latter is often strongly
assertive. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?</p></div>

<p>This is equivalent to asking a question and answering it at
the same time. It asks in words, “was ever?” It answers in
inflection, “there never was.” Grammatically, then, it is a
question; rhetorically, it is an exclamation. Here is another
form of Figurative Interrogation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Are you going out? (No answer.) Are you going out? (I
demand an answer.)</p></div>

<p>In this case, the second question becomes a demand. The
speaker cares for an answer not so much because of any interest
in it as such, but because he desires his authority respected.</p>

<p>The following examples of Figurative Interrogation should
be carefully studied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Is there a single atrocity of the French more unprincipled and
inhuman than that of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, in Poland?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Did he not know that he was making history that hour? Did he

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have you, gentlemen of the jury, considered the price the state
asks the prisoner to pay for what is only an indiscretion at most? I
repeat, have you considered the price?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Has the gentleman <em>done</em>? Has he <em>completely</em> done?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A very interesting psychological question arises in connection
with Figurative Interrogation. It has been shown how
the grammatical question becomes an oratorical assertion; but
there is a point in assertion beyond which it may pass and
become an intense emotional question. In this sentence, “Shall
not the Judge of all the earth do right?” we have an illustration.
There are three possibilities here. First: a simple
question looking for information. Second: an exclamation
equivalent to, Who does not know that the Judge of all the
earth shall do right? Third: a skeptical question (with considerable
emotion) is it possible that any one would deny that
the Judge of all the earth shall do right?</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply examples and make many
refinements of this principle underlying the use of the rising
inflection. A careful study, however, of those given should
suffice to impress upon the reader that the rising inflection
will be given whenever for any reason whatsoever there is no
desire to assert.</p>

<p>Incompleteness (implied or otherwise) is marked by the
rising inflection; completeness by the falling. We are all
aware that the falling inflection marks completed sense, so
that this principle will require neither elaboration nor illustration.
Attention must be called, however, to the fact that we
often assert strongly in the middle of a sentence. This phase
of the subject has been so well described by another<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that we
quote as follows:</p>

<p>“Momentary Completeness.&mdash;This applies to any clause,
phrase, or even word, which has, for any reason, enough separate
force to constitute, at the moment, an entire thought, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to call for a separate affirmation of the mind. This momentary
completeness may arise:</p>

<p>“1. From the logical importance of the clause, phrase, or
word requiring a strong affirmative emphasis.</p>

<p>“2. From an elliptical construction&mdash;one in which each
part could be reasonably expanded into a complete proposition.</p>

<p>“<em>Example</em> of 1 would be this sentence from Webster:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It comes, if it come at all, like the outbreaking of a fountain
from the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous,
original, native force.</p></div>

<p>“Here the ideas of spontaneity, originality, nativeness, are each
so important to the thought that the mind is called upon to make
a separate affirmation upon each one.</p>

<p>“<em>Examples</em> of 2 are found in some of the connected clauses in
this passage from Byron’s <cite>Dream of Darkness</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I had a dream, which was not all a dream.</p>
<p class="verse0">The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars</p>
<p class="verse0">Did wander, darkling, in the eternal space,</p>
<p class="verse0">Rayless and pathless, and the icy earth</p>
<p class="verse0">Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air.</p>
<p class="verse0">Morn came and went&mdash;and came, and brought no day,</p>
<p class="verse0">And men forgot their passions in the dread</p>
<p class="verse0">Of this their desolation; and all hearts</p>
<p class="verse0">Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light.</p>
</div></div>

<p>“The ‘loose’ sentence presents a typical case of momentary
completeness, each added clause or element giving a separate,
subjoined thought.</p>

<p>“In the following cases the period mark inclosed in
brackets, [.], indicates the place at which the sentence might
close; and the words in parentheses are those which might be
supplied in constructing separate complete propositions. The
reconstruction suggests the probable process of thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The next day he voted for that repeal [.], and he would have
spoken for it too [.], if an illness had not prevented it.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Englishman in America will feel that this is slavery&mdash;that
it is <em>legal</em> slavery, will be no compensation, either to his feelings or
his understanding.</p></div>

<p>“The Englishman in America will feel that this is slavery
[.]. (The mere fact) that it is <em>legal</em> slavery will (in his estimation)
be no compensation (at all). (It will not be (in any
degree) satisfactory) either to his feelings or his understanding.</p>

<p>“Completeness is marked in the voice by a falling slide;
that indicating finality usually descends at least a fifth (from
<em>sol</em> down to <em>do</em>), and is preceded by a more or less distinct
rising melody. This cadential melody may carry the voice so
high in pitch that the falling slide will be as great as an
octave. The indication of momentary completeness is also a
falling slide, varying in extent from a third to a fifth, but not
so marked as that of finality, and usually not preceded by any
special rising melody.</p>

<p>“In the following example note momentary completeness
on ‘man,’ ‘woman,’ ‘child,’ and finality on the climacteric
word ‘beast.’ Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They saw not one màn, not one wòman, not one chìld,<br />
not one four footed beast.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“It is especially important to study the relation of momentary
completeness in connection with dependent clauses. As
a rule, a definitive clause does not stand in the relation of
momentary completeness, but in that of subordination or
anticipation. A supplemental clause, on the other hand, is
distinctively complete. This relation is not always shown,
either by the punctuation, or by exact use of relative pronouns.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
In strictness, ‘who’ and ‘which’, as already said,
should always mark supplemental relations; ‘that,’ definitive.
Considerations of euphony, however, often overrule grammatical
and rhetorical principles. The problem in regard to
dependent clauses is; to decide whether the subordinate clause
contains additional thought, or only modifying thought. The
best practical test will be found in paraphrasing. If a dependent
clause is truly definitive, it may be reduced to a brief
element,&mdash;often to a single word, which may be incorporated
in the first clause.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Example.</em>&mdash;Lafayette was intrusted by Washington with all
kinds of services ... the laborious and complicated, which
required skill and patience; the perilous, that demanded nerve.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Everett</span>.</p></div>

<p>“In this example, it is obvious that the clause introduced
by ‘which’ and the one beginning with ‘that’ stand in precisely
the same relation, the change being made for euphony. It is
obvious also that both dependent clauses are supplemental
rather than definitive. In both of these clauses, therefore,
there is an added thought, and this gives the relation of
momentary completeness at the words ‘complicated’ and ‘perilous.’</p>

<p>“The ear, under the guidance of the logical and rhetorical
insight, gives a much more sensitive and more accurate punctuation
than can be indicated by printer’s marks or grammarian’s
rules. Not the words, nor the grammatical
elements, nor the customary and traditional rendering,
determine grouping or inflection, but rather the speaker’s
immediate purpose at the moment of the utterance.</p>

<p>“The principle of momentary completeness is strikingly
exemplified in the case of a ‘division of the question’ in parliamentary
proceedings. Division is called for because each item
is considered as separately important enough to demand the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
entire attention. The same is often true in the announcement
of a proposition containing several different elements, or
of a text of Scripture suggesting many separate thoughts.”</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>It need hardly be said that the rule so often given, that
“the voice should rise at a comma,” is ridiculous. It often
does, it is true,&mdash;not because of the comma, but because of
the motive.</p>

<p>The purpose of the following drills is not to train the student
in the manner of making inflections, but rather to
impress upon his mind the fact that rhetorically a sentence
may be complete even though the point of completion be not
marked by a full stop. In other words, the drill is one in
mental, rather than vocal, technique.</p>

<p>The student must determine the purpose in every case, and
then trust his voice to manifest that purpose.</p>

<p>It is often a matter of judgment whether we shall interpret
a phrase as momentarily complete or as pointing forward,
incomplete. Sometimes either interpretation would be
acceptable, but, as a rule, one conveys the author’s intention
better than the other. For instance, in the following extract
from <cite>The American Indian</cite>, the author says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a race they have withered from the land. Their arrows are
broken, their springs have dried up, their cabins are in the dust.
Their council-fire has long since gone out on the shore, and their
war-cry is fast fading to the untrodden West.</p></div>

<p>It seems clear that in the second sentence the author is
not enumerating minor details which form one larger
whole, but that each statement is a sentence complete in
itself, and so important that spontaneously we separate it from
the others not merely by a pause but by a downward inflection.</p>

<p>If we were saying to another, “I bought my children
firecrackers, torpedoes, skyrockets, and pinwheels,” we should
use rising inflections until we closed our sentence on “pinwheels.”
But it would be quite natural for the child, greatly
excited by his presents, to use the downward inflection on those
words, and these inflections would mark the importance, to him,
of each separate gift. He would say, “I have firecrackers,&mdash;torpedoes,&mdash;skyrockets,&mdash;and
pinwheels.”</p>

<p>Circumflex inflections are the expression of complex
mental states. Note this in the following examples:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not inferior to this was the wisdom of him who resolved to
shear the wolf. What, shear a <em>wolf</em>! Have you considered the
<em>danger</em> of the attempt? No, says the madman, I have considered
nothing but the <em>right</em>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Oh, no!</em> He wouldn’t accept a <em>bribe</em>; of course not.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You meant no <em>harm</em>; oh, no: your thoughts are innocent.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It isn’t the <em>secret</em> I care about; it’s the slight, Mr. Caudle.</p></div>

<p>Difficult as is the subject of circumflex inflections, the
difficulty is very much reduced when we bear in mind that the
elements which compose them are the same as those with
which we have been dealing. In Longfellow’s <cite>King Robert
of Sicily</cite>, the Angel asks the king, “Who art thou?” To
which Robert answers, sneeringly, “I am the King.” Now,
on the word “I” we may expect to hear the rising circumflex
(composed of a falling followed by a rising inflection) which
the following paraphrase will justify: He dares ask me who
I am! What audacity! Do you dare ask such a question of
me? Would you know who I am? Perhaps a diagram will
make this clearer:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Ĭ.<br />
He dares ask me who I am. Do you not know? I am. etc.
</div></div>

<p>Professor Chamberlain has made this question so clear that
we quote from him again:</p>

<p>“Paraphrase for Complex Relations: These, as already
seen, are cases of combined ideas, expressed by composite
motions of the voice, called circumflexes. In order to justify
such double motion of the voice, the mind of the reader needs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to recognize the combination implied in the words. He will
make himself surer of this by analyzing, or separating into
its component parts, each composite idea.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Be not too tâme neither.</p></div>

<p>“Here is a plain implication of one member of the antithesis;
and it might be expanded thus, As you are not to be too
extrávagant in your expression, so you are not to be too quìet.</p>

<p>“This combination of separable elements might be illustrated
by diagram, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_069a.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
As you are not to be extravagant, so you are not to be too quiet.<br />
Be not too tâme neither.
</div></div>

<p>“Here the negative, or anticipatory, clause is, in the condensed
form, suggested by the negative, or rising, part of the
circumflex; the positive clause, by the falling part of the tone.</p>

<p>“In a similar way two separate elements, both of which are
verbally expressed, may be combined in one elliptical or complex
clause; e. g.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I come to bûry Caesar, not to práise him.</p></div>

<p>“Inverting clauses:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_069b.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
I come not to praise Caesar. but I come to bury him.<br />
I come to bûry Caesar.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“The same method of illustration may be extended <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum</i>.”</p>

<p>There is one feature of circumflex inflection somewhat common
but seldom treated, the understanding of which is very
helpful to the teacher. This feature is observed when there
are assertion and incompleteness in the same word. For
instance, “John Brown,” being the important idea in the
following sentence, would be uttered with a falling inflection;
but since the mind is glancing forward from “Brown” the
rising inflection would mark that fact. Hence, the two states
of mind would be manifested in a combined inflection the
psychology of which should now be clear.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Brown was one of the most striking figures of the anti-slavery
agitation.</p></div>

<p>We have the same phenomenon on the word “Sicily” in
the following extract, except that the falling inflection is on
the first two syllables and the rising on the third:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane</p>
<p class="verse0">And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine</p>
<p><ins><hr class="r30" /></ins></p>
<p class="verse2">... heard the priests chant the Magnificat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The extent, or width, of the inflection depends upon the
amount of collateral thinking. Thus a simple question as,
“Is your name Brown?” will take an inflection of about a
third of the musical scale, while the inflection of Cassius on
“Chastisement,” in the example previously given, will be
probably a full octave. The length of the inflection is
explained by the philosophy of “Time”: it is a matter of the
importance or non-importance of the idea. The direction of
the inflection is explained by the philosophy of “Pitch”: it is
determined by the purpose, or motive.</p>

<p>Varied melody is found in the speech of every-day life.
Note how the voice continually runs up and down in a conversation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on commonplace topics. The moment the subject
grows serious and dignified, the discriminative elements
largely disappear and with them the varied melody; until in
solemn prayer, invocation, and certain forms of meditation in
the absence of desire to insist on the importance of any one
word, or the absence of the purpose to discriminate between
one phase and another, we approach very close to the monotone.
Let us remember, however, that it is not the emotion
as such that affects the melody, but the mental content of the
emotion.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may see the application of the
foregoing principles, an analysis of a complete poem is
appended. There may be a difference of opinion concerning
details, but it must be remembered that the value of this
analysis for the student lies in the fact that it should teach
him that some interpretation is to be definitely decided on.
The average reading is haphazard; so that one must gain a
great deal through the mental drill necessary to decide the
various questions that come up in the course of such an
analysis as that here undertaken. It is a common experience
to hear a pupil read a passage one way at one time and a
different way at another. It would therefore seem to be
better to read a passage incorrectly with some reason behind
the error, than to read it correctly as a matter of accident,
with the chance that the next time it is read the expression
will be quite different. The greatest value of such analyses is
found in the improvement in the student’s power of discrimination.
<em>The melody, which manifests the purpose, the motive,
is the very life of good reading.</em></p>

<h4>PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS.</h4>

<p>Much of what has been said concerning the pedagogical
aspects of the discussion of “Time” may be repeated here.
Drills in inflections as such are of very little value and
potentially very harmful. Occasionally we hear the argument
that a pupil has no ear for inflections, and that the drill
is to train his ear. Most pupils have no difficulty in making
proper inflections, so that for them class drills are time wasted;
for those whose reading is monotonous, because of lack of
melodic variety, the best drills are those which teach them to
make a careful analysis of the sentences, and those which
awaken them to the necessity of impressing the thought upon
others. We deceive ourselves when we proceed to correct the
error of monotony in any mechanical, artificial way.</p>

<p>We have learned that, when a pupil has the proper motive
in mind and is desirous of conveying his intention to another,
a certain melody will always manifest that intention. The
melody, then, is the criterion of the pupil’s purpose. We
expect a certain melody with certain phrases. When that
melody is heard, we are scarcely conscious of its presence;
when another is heard, we are struck as by a discord of music
when we expect concord. The moment a pupil loses sight of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the exact meaning of a phrase and its relation to the other
phrases, that moment his melody betrays him. Now the
teacher must be able to translate the false melody. He must
determine the pupil’s purpose (or absence of any purpose)
behind the incorrect melody, remove the wrong purpose, put
in its stead the true purpose, and rely upon natural instincts
to do the rest. Herein lies the great value to the teacher of
a knowledge of the psychology of the criterion of pitch.</p>

<p>Suppose a pupil reads, “Up from the meadows green
with corn,” using a rising circumflex on “meadows.” This
would show at once that “meadows” was contrasted in his
mind with something else. Remove the contrast, direct his
mind forward from that word to the next phrase, and the
proper melody will come. Some teachers, especially those
engaged in the teaching of young children, have a somewhat
patronizing melody in all they say and read. This melody is
overflowing with circumflexes, which are soon copied by the
class. Let the teacher free himself from this patronizing
mental condition and talk to the children as if they were men
and women, and the peculiar melody will disappear from the
voices of both teacher and pupil. It is rather difficult to
present this melody in graphic form, but the following diagram
may prove suggestive:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Now children let us all take our books.
<div class="caption">
</div></div>

<p>It is hardly to be believed that there is so much ignorance
as to the meaning of inflection. During the past two years,
in schools of our largest cities, the author has heard teachers
reprimand their pupils for allowing their voices “to fall at a
comma.” As if commas were intended to indicate vocal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
expression! Once when a bright lad used a falling inflection
on “want,” in such a sentence as “What do you want?” a class
nearly shook their hands off in their endeavors to attract the
teacher’s attention, in order that, when he said, “What’s
wrong?” they might shout at the top of their voices, “He let
his voice down at a question mark.”</p>

<p>One of the commonest of misunderstandings that prevail
among us, is that the rising inflection is always to be given
upon words preceding commas, and also that it must never be
given at the end of a sentence. It is hoped that these fallacies
have been entirely exploded, and that the teacher has learned
that motive, and motive only, governs the inflection. We used
to be told to count one at a comma, two at a semi-colon, and
four at a period. Such admonitions are exactly on a par with
those just referred to.</p>

<p>Teachers should bear in mind that pupils do not need to
have a musical ear in order to read with correct melody. As
we have stated again and again, melody is the result of
varying tension, and that has nothing to do with the ability to
recognize tones. With singing this is different. There we
must strike certain notes, and ear training is necessary; but
speech melody is instinctive, and all that is necessary for its
development is mental training and practice in reading&mdash;not
voice drills as such.</p>

<p>The melody of long sentences presents a case of peculiar
difficulty. Where the sentence is long, especially where it is
long and involved, the pupil’s melody is often faulty because
he cannot hold the thought in mind from beginning to end.
Pupils should be trained on sentences specially chosen to
develop their powers of continuous thinking. These sentences
should be carefully analyzed and thoroughly discussed
before reading. The following examples, while too difficult
for younger pupils, will afford good practice for the teacher:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects
spread out before us, for us and our children. Beyond that I
seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at
least, that curtain may not rise. God grant that on my vision
never may be opened what lies behind. When my eyes shall be
turned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven, may I not see
him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once
glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a
land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal
blood! Let their last feeble and lingering glance, rather, behold the
gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known and honored <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'throughout the earht'">throughout

streaming in their original luster, not a stripe erased or polluted,

interrogatory as, “What is all this worth?” nor those other words of

forever, one and inseparable.”&mdash;<em>Reply to Hayne</em>. <span class="smcap">Webster</span>.</p></div>

<p>Note that the force of “may I not see him” continues to
“fraternal blood,” and consequently that there should be
rising inflections on “Union,” “dissevered,” “discordant,”
“belligerent,” “feuds,” and “blood.” And note further that
“What is all this worth?” and “Liberty first, and Union
afterward,” are anticipative and hence will take a rising inflection
on “worth” and “afterward.”</p>

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<span class="fs60">THE CRITERION OF QUALITY</span></h3>


<p>Thus far we have been considering the criteria of states
essentially intellectual. “Time” has to do with the extent of
the thought; “Pitch” with the purpose. Quality manifests
emotional states. By Quality we mean that subtle element
in the voice by which is expressed at one time tenderness, at
another harshness, at another awe, and so on through the
whole gamut of feeling.</p>

<p>In order to prove that the quality (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">timbre</i>, the French call
it) of the voice is the result of emotional conditions, we must
first understand what we may term the physics of quality.
The number of air waves striking the ear in a given time
determines the pitch; the width of the waves determines the
volume of sound; the shape of the waves determines the
quality. But how is the shape of air waves affected? It
would take us too far from our subject to discuss this question
in detail.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Let it suffice that the shape of the air wave, and
hence the quality, is dependent upon the texture of the vibrating
body. We recognize at once the different qualities
respectively of the flute, piano, violin, harp or cornet; it is the
difference in the texture of the vibrating substances that
enables us to do this. Why will the artist pay thousands of
dollars for a Stradivarius or Cremona violin? Not because of
its age, but because of the quality of the tone he can bring out
on that instrument, which is impossible on other makes of
violins. The fashioners of these old instruments possessed
a secret of treating or seasoning the wood that gave to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
products a tone quality the violin-makers of to-day endeavor
in vain to reproduce. This treatment affected the texture of
the wood, and hence the quality.</p>

<p>To him who plays upon the human instrument of the voice,
is given a great advantage over other artists. He can change
the quality of his tone almost at will, while they can only
approximate these changes. The tone as it comes from the
vocal bands is comparatively colorless, but the size and shape
of the reinforcing cavities (the larynx, pharynx, mouth,
and nares), and the texture of their membranes, determine
the quality of the tone that reaches the ear. Now, the size
and shape of some of these can be changed at will, and are
often modified unconsciously by emotion. The same may be
said of the texture of the surface against which the tone
impinges as it comes from the larynx. The shape of the nares
and the texture of its membrane are virtually fixed, as is the
texture of the roof of the mouth and the pharynx. Herein is
the explanation of the individuality of voices. But the shape
of the mouth and of the pharynx may be considerably modified
by the action of the tongue, the raising, lowering, or contracting
of the larynx, and the movements of the soft palate. It
is, therefore, clear that the quality of the voice is partly fixed
and partly changeable.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to discuss the effect of emotion upon
the quality, we must first recognize that voice defects are of
three kinds: (1) Those arising from disease or accident, such
as catarrh, obstructions in the nose, enlarged tonsils, broken
nose, and many others. These require medical or surgical
treatment. (2) Those arising from congenital defects, which
can be only partially removed, such as cleft palate, abnormally
narrow nares, and the like. (3) Those arising out of the temperament
of the man and the improper use of his voice.</p>

<p>It should now be plain that when we say that emotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
affects the quality of the tone, we mean the peculiar
quality of a particular man. If a speaker’s voice is nasal,
we do not claim that that quality is expressive of any emotion.
On the contrary, nasal quality is the distinguishing characteristic
of his voice, but that quality can be modified by emotion.
In other words, there can be a nasal-tender quality, or a nasal-harsh
quality, the tender or harsh feeling accounting for the
difference.</p>

<p>Paul Heyse has said, “The voice is the man.” What did
he mean by that? He did not mean that a throaty voice
indicated one temperament, and a nasal voice another, but
that the emotional man, the spiritual man, has a certain
texture of muscle. This texture affects the quality of his
natural voice, whatever that voice may be, and consequently
the quality of the voice manifests the man. If we will
interpret this dictum broadly, no fault will be found with it.
Who does not recognize the blustering man by his bellowing
tone? the fawning hypocrite by his oily quality? the aggressive,
assertive individual by his harsh guttural? In all probability,
Heyse meant more than quality, in the sense in which
we use it here; but granting this, his saying is of very wide
application even in this restricted realm.</p>

<p>How does emotion affect the quality of the voice? Emotion
is essentially a muscular condition. This condition is
determined by the amount of nervous energy sent to the
muscles, and this energy determines the muscular texture.
Tender emotions mean tender texture, a relaxed condition of
the muscles; while harsh quality is the result not only of
throat contraction (change in the shape of the reinforcing
cavity) but of constricted muscle, harsh texture. This is all
there is to the philosophy of “Quality.”</p>

<p>Dr. Rush, in his <cite>Philosophy of the Human Voice</cite>, has
named many of these qualities. He calls them Normal, Orotund,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Guttural, Pectoral, Falsetto, and so on; and mentions
the emotional conditions that manifest themselves through
these various forms. On the whole, his classification is sound;
but there is one gross error, due either to himself or his followers,
that must be considered here. The Orotund (the
enlarged natural) quality is more than a loud voice. It is a
full voice with a quality that cannot better be described
than by the term richness. Many students have endeavored
to obtain this quality by shouting, or by holding the mouth
as if gaping, and have developed only loudness without
a trace of soulfulness, or merely a round, hollow hot-potato-in-the-throat
kind of voice. There is no objection to
the use of the term Orotund to characterize that rich, full
tone suggestive of deep, full, enlarged feeling; but we must
bear in mind that loudness is not only not necessary for the
Orotund, but is often no part of it at all. The Orotund, as
we have said, is that quality of which the main characteristics
are roundness and richness. One who is restricted is not
likely to use this quality. It can come only when there is the
utmost freedom of the entire vocal region. When we have
removed the tension which may be “the man,” or the result
of bad vocal training, we shall get that enlarged quality, which
should not, as is so often the case, manifest merely the larger
emotional states, but should be the natural voice of the
speaker. The Orotund manifests dignity above all else; it
manifests the large, grand spirit. Of course, we do not mean
an affected Orotund, but an easy, large, unrestricted quality
showing the largeness of the soul behind it. To develop this
quality, let the student use his imagination. Let him dwell
for a long time upon the sublimity and grandeur of such passages
as follow. Then let him abandon himself to the emotion
aroused through his contemplation, and in time the genuine
Orotund will come. And so only can it come. So important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
is this phase of the subject that we repeat: The tone expressive
of elevated feeling “cannot be mechanically produced, or
manufactured independently of the general mental and physical
conditions.” The imagination must lead, otherwise we
shall have big voices without big quality. That peculiar
quality expressive of enlarged feeling is not necessarily loud.
In fact, the voice may not be strong, but, at the same time, it
may <em>suggest</em> grandeur and sublimity far better than a voice that
has sheer loudness. But, if the student will practice faithfully,
he may be assured that his voice will receive more genuine
training through these exercises than through a whole volume
of <em>merely</em> technical drills. Develop the imagination, the soul,
and the voice will grow through the effort of the soul to go
out in expression. But let him avoid mere shouting and vociferating,
even if he never gets a voice.</p>

<p>If the student has not the imagination, he must develop it.
There are many loud voices, but few with soulful quality.
But what avails this loudness? Certainly it enables one to be
heard above the din of voices and the roar of the waves, but it
never stirs the nobler emotions of an audience; and unless one
can do that he is anything but an orator. Mere loudness is
rant&mdash;nothing less.</p>

<p>Many students, for one reason or another, either have no
ability to express elevated feeling in public, or repress it through
diffidence or shyness. Let such remember that we are constantly
experiencing and expressing this feeling in our everyday
life; that it is simply an enlargement of a more or less
commonplace feeling; and let him begin with the simple
examples that are set down first. Any one can say, What a
lovely day this is! Well, that is a mild form of elevated feeling.
Let him imagine it is graduation day, and that rain had
been threatening to fall all the previous night. It is daylight
now; and as he opens his eyes and looks up at the cloudless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sky, will he not exclaim with elevated feeling, What a glorious
day we’re going to have!</p>

<p>By “elevated feelings” one must not understand those
only that are serious and solemn. Whenever the imagination
is enkindled by the contemplation of what is large, dignified,
grand, sublime, the emotions are stirred, and find expression
in enlarged, soulful quality.</p>

<p>Most of all, fellow-citizens, if your sons ask whose example they
shall imitate, what will you say? For you know well it is not
music, nor the gymnasiums, nor the schools, that mold young
men; it is much more the public proclamations, the public example.
If you take one whose life has no high purpose, one who mocks at
morals, and crown him in the theater, every boy who sees it is
corrupted. When a bad man suffers his deserts, the people learn;
on the contrary, when a man <span class="smcap">VOTES AGAINST WHAT IS NOBLE AND

promptly say, “Your lesson is impertinent and a bore.” Beware,
therefore, Athenians, remembering posterity will rejudge your

</div></div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Venerable men! you have come down to us from a former
generation. Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives,
that you might behold this joyous day. You are now where you
stood fifty years ago, this very hour, with your brothers and your
neighbors, shoulder to shoulder, in the strife for your country.
Behold, how altered! The same heavens are indeed above your
heads; the same ocean rolls at your feet; but all else how changed!</p>

<p>You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you see no mixed volume
of smoke and flame rising from burning Charlestown. The
ground strewed with the dead and dying; the impetuous charge;
the steady and successful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault;
the summoning of all that is manly to repeated resistance; a
thousand bosoms freely and fearlessly bared in an instant to
whatever of terror there may be in war and death; all these you
have witnessed, but you witness them no more.</p>

<p>All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis, its towers and
roofs, which you then saw filled with wives and children and
countrymen in distress and terror, and looking with unutterable
emotions for the issue of the combat, have presented you to-day
with the sight of its whole happy population come out to welcome
and greet you with a universal jubilee. Yonder proud ships, by a
felicity of position appropriately lying at the foot of this mount,
and seeming fondly to cling around it, are not means of annoyance to
you, but your country’s own means of destruction and defense.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Webster.</span></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What lesson shall those lips teach us? Before that still, calm
brow let us take a new baptism. How can we stand here without a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fresh and utter consecration? These tears! how shall we dare even
to offer consolation? Only lips fresh from such a vow have the
right to mingle their words with your tears. We envy you your
nearer place to these martyred children of God. I do not believe
slavery will go down in blood. Ours is an age of thought. Hearts
are stronger than swords. That last fortnight! How sublime its
lesson! the Christian one of conscience,&mdash;of truth. Virginia is
weak, because each man’s heart said amen to John Brown. His
words,&mdash;they are stronger even than his rifles. These crushed a
State. Those have changed the thoughts of millions, and will
yet crush slavery. Men said, “Would he had died in arms!” God
ordered better, and granted to him and the slave those noble prison
hours,&mdash;that single hour of death; granted him a higher than the
soldier’s place,&mdash;that of teacher; the echoes of his rifles have died
away in the hills,&mdash;a million hearts guard his words. God bless
this roof,&mdash;make it bless us. We dare not say bless you, children
of this home! you stand nearer to one whose lips God touched, and
we rather bend for your blessings. God make us all worthier of
him whose dust we lay among these hills he loved. Here he
girded himself and went forth to battle. Fuller success than his
heart ever dreamed God granted him. He sleeps in the blessings of
the crushed and the poor, and men believe more firmly in virtue,
now that such a man has lived. Standing here, let us thank God
for a firmer faith and fuller hope.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wendell Phillips.</span></p></div>

<p>A great deal of space has been given to the preceding illustrations
because the quality necessary to express the emotions
in those selections is very rare. Rare for two reasons: first,
because we dwell so much of the time in the realm of the so-called
practical that we lose interest in the sublimer aspects
presented in poetry; and, secondly, we do not express these
larger emotions freely and often. Expression, like all other
powers, comes through practice.</p>

<p>The second distinct quality is what has been called the
Normal. This is the voice of everyday life, the voice in
which we carry on the conversation of the home, the schoolroom,
and the business of life generally. We need no special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
practice in this quality, but it is well to recognize it in order
that we may compare with it the other qualities. The following
extract would be expressed in Normal quality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly
on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players
do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. And do not saw
the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently: for in
the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your
passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split
the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of
nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have such
a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod:
pray you avoid it.</p>

<p>Be not too tame either, but let your own discretion be your tutor:
suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this
special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of Nature; for
anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end,
both at the first, and now, was, and is, to hold, as ’twere, the mirror
up to Nature, to show Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own image,
and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now,
this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the
which one must, in your allowance, o’erweigh a whole theater of
others. Oh, there be players that I have seen play&mdash;and heard
others praise, and that highly&mdash;not to speak it profanely, that,
neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian,
pagan, or man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought
some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.&mdash;<cite>Hamlet</cite>, Act iii.,
Sc. 2.</p></div>

<p>In a work which makes no pretension to cover the whole
realm of elocution, it would be out of place to discuss the
more extravagant forms of emotion, such as terror, rage, hate,
and the like. In order, however, to give this phase of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
subject a certain approximation to complete treatment, it may
be well to touch upon these abnormal emotional states and the
respective qualities in which they find expression.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of feeling that so affects the action of
the vocal apparatus as to produce a breathy tone. It would be
idle and misleading to enumerate all the occasions upon which
we might expect to hear this aspirated voice. Suffice it that a
sense of oppression resulting from any one of many causes: the
desire not to be overheard; the weakness of old age and
disease&mdash;any of these conditions may produce the aspirated
tone. Aspiration does not manifest any one emotion, but may
accompany many. There may be considerable aspiration
mixed with the expression of joy, as well as with the expression
of hate or despair. It is well to bear this in mind, for
many text books give the “Aspirated Quality” as a specific
kind of voice manifesting specific emotions and those only.
When we observe that this quality is found in awe, terror,
hate, and like emotions; in debility; and when we wish to
whisper; the unscientific nature of such a classification becomes
sufficiently clear. A few examples are appended:</p>

<p>There are two opposite qualities of voice well known to
singers: the bright, ringing tone, and the dark, sombre,
covered tone. This distinction is, for the purposes of the
public-school teacher, far more valuable than most others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Joy, happiness, buoyancy, exuberance, are likely, when
there are no marked physical defects, to find expression
in the bright tone; while sorrow and the moods of introspection
may often modify the texture of the vibrating substances
so as to produce the darker quality.</p>

<h4>PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS.</h4>

<p>For the third time, it is well to be reminded that drills in
the elements of expression as such have no place in public-school
training. Perhaps in no part of the work is more care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
necessary than in the development of the pupil’s power to
express feeling. If we were discussing methods of teaching
elocution outside of the public school, the author would be
compelled to protest strongly against a prevalent practice of
endeavoring to develop the different vocal qualities apart from
the emotion that produces these qualities. But the difficulty
in public-school methods is that they pay comparatively
little attention to emotional expression. As a general thing,
so educators say, there is either no feeling (“no expression,”
some put it), or, what is worse, there is a palpable affectation
of feeling. Somehow, it has come to be considered
“girlish” for a boy to put feeling into his reading, especially
tender feeling; and for the girl to do so is considered a sure
indication of weakness. The atmosphere of the school-room
is not conducive to the development of emotional power, and
if, by any chance, a shoot should peep out of the soil, it dies
for want of light and warmth. Emotion in itself is a good
thing, when properly guided; but we need emotion in reading
because it is a sign that the pupil can be moved by the contemplation
of the noble, the tender, the true. It is a sign
that the children have that precious gift of imagination.
Where there is no opportunity for the expression of feeling,
there must result a great loss in expressive power and eventually
in power of imagination. Such a loss is irremediable, for
there follows in its wake inability to appreciate the finer breath
and spirit of literature.</p>

<p>Our public schools, except in particularly favored districts,
can do very little towards training the voices of the pupils.
Even when there are special teachers the best results are found
not so much in the voices as in the ability to read music. To
train the human voice requires genius and much particular
training, and we cannot expect that school communities will
appoint such teachers for many, many generations. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
development of the child’s powers of expression through the
stimulation of his imagination and emotions will do wonders
for his voice. So that here we have a third reason for pleading
so earnestly for more careful attention to this aspect of vocal
expression. One hears so often the excuse, “Oh, he hasn’t
any voice; that’s why he can’t read.” The author believes
with that great specialist in the child voice, William L.
Tomlins, that, except when there are serious structural
defects, the imagination and soul will make a voice. Let it
be remarked, that the claim is not made that vocal training is
unnecessary. But when we look at the conditions that make
impossible the appointment of skilled specialists in voice, we
give up in despair of effecting for some time to come any
radical change. Further, a good voice does not imply a good
reader. Since, then, we can not get the voice teacher; and
since, when we can, we are not assured he will develop good
expressionists, it should be a great stimulus to the conscientious
teacher to learn that the very highest quality of the
voice, soulfulness, may be developed through stimulation of
the imagination. And, further, let us note that expression
that comes in this way can never be affected.</p>

<p>The teacher now knows that emotion affects the quality of
tone. Let him then use this knowledge as he has learned to
use his knowledge of the other criteria. We recognize instinctively
the quality that expresses sorrow, tenderness, joy and
the other states of feeling. When the proper quality does not
appear it is because the child has no feeling or the wrong feeling&mdash;generally
the former. There is but one way to correct
the expression, i. e., by stimulating the imagination.</p>

<p>This is a most difficult task, but that fact does not excuse
us from attempting it. In <a href="#PART_TWO">Part II</a> this feature will be
treated at length.</p>

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<span class="fs60">THE CRITERION OF FORCE</span></h3>


<p>Force manifests the degree of mental energy. When we
speak in a loud voice there is much energy; when softly, there
is little. This criterion is the easiest of the four to understand,
because, perhaps, it is the most tangible. We need
not stay, therefore, to illustrate, but may pass on to consider
a subdivision of Force, the understanding of which is very
necessary to good teaching.</p>

<p>In reading the following lines note how explosive is the
utterance on the emphatic words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Down! down! your lances, down!</p>
<p class="verse0">Bear back both friend and foe!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Now observe how differently we apply the force on the
emphatic words of this extract:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Ye gods! ye gods! Must I endure all this?</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the first example, upon the emphatic words, there was
heard a loud explosion of the voice, followed by a gradual
diminution in force; in the second, the voice perceptibly
swelled on the significant words. This swell or diminish has
been called “Stress.” Perhaps it is not the best word, but
since its meaning in the sense in which we are using it here is
generally understood, it may be well to retain it. “Stress”
refers to the manner of applying the force to the emphatic
syllable. In the first of the preceding illustrations, the greatest
force was at the beginning of the emphatic syllable. This
form is called “Radical” stress. In the second, the force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was applied in the opposite manner. This form is denominated
“Final” stress.</p>

<p>Radical stress marks all forms of animated utterance. It
is the result of the normal action of the vocal chords, which,
coming together before syllabic impulses, suddenly part,
causing a slight degree of explosion. Absence of this form of
stress gives the delivery a kind of drawling effect. It is further
to be noted that even in those utterances characterized
by other forms of stress this form yet manifests itself on most
of the syllables. After the student has practiced the other
forms of stress, he will better understand this remark. He
will have noticed that the other forms are significant just in so
far as they differ from this one, which is the normal; and,
further, that because the radical stress <em>is</em> normal, the use of
other forms of stress on a comparatively few (emphatic)
syllables will give a very significant coloring to a whole paragraph.</p>

<p>We must guard against over-developing this abruptness.
If we do not, our delivery will be very likely to become explosive,
and then we shall create the impression of being too dogmatic.
On the other hand, slovenliness and drawling may be
overcome by drilling on this element of expression, and much
vitality will thereby be imparted to the speaking.</p>

<p>All speech, then, has this abrupt character. It has become
so familiar to us that we do not notice it except, as it were,
in its absence, when the delivery becomes drawling or
slovenly. Hence, we can say that radical stress in its milder
forms is not essentially expressive; it is an inherent part of
our vocal production. It becomes expressive only in its
stronger forms. The student whose delivery is sufficiently
vital need not practice on the milder form. It need hardly
be said that the form and the thought should not be separated
in this practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It should also be borne in mind that there are different
degrees of stress as well as kinds. Professor Raymond truly
says, “Never confuse the kind of stress with the degree.” To
illustrate: the decided stroke of the voice is heard in,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Come, and trip it as ye go</p>
<p class="verse0">On the light fantastic toe;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">but a strong attack would spoil the daintiness. Let us
remember that a grain of gunpowder explodes as well as a ton.
This admonition applies as well to other forms of stress.</p>

<p>It has been urged, that if the claim is true that the complete
assimilation of the thought and feeling will, through
practice, lead to adequate expression, why bother the student
with such drills as these? The answer is plain. One’s
temperament may be of such a nature that he cannot express
a single sentence without, say, the greatest insistency. The
insistency is temperamental, and it shows in everything the
speaker does. By a careful study of “Stress,” he is introduced
to his own consciousness, soon recognizes his weakness,
and his delivery is improved through improving his mental
action. If this is true for the creative speaker, the orator, how
much more is it true of him who reads or recites the words of
another.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a well-known minister spoke these words:
“You may read the tragedies of Sophocles, and the philosophy
of Plato and Aristotle; you may be familiar with the lore of
the Hindus and the Brahmins; you may know your Shakespeare,
your Milton, and your Dante, your Wordsworth, your
Browning, and your Tennyson, but [raising aloft a limp-covered
Bible] it’s <em>all here</em>!” And he brought the book down
on the palm of his hand with a thwack that was heard
throughout the building. He fairly exploded on “all here,”
and the congregation laughed. Paraphrased, his stress said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
I&mdash;I, who know what I am talking about, tell you people&mdash;deny
it if you can&mdash;it’s all here. There was no appeal, no
tenderness, no gentle persuasiveness. His purpose ought to
have been (to avoid argument, let it be said that the context
justifies this remark&mdash;he was appealing for a more careful and
reverential study of the Bible) to express, Oh, my friends, this
holy work, this revelation of God’s goodness, contains all you
need. Why not take it up, and study it? You read all
literatures; will you not read this too? The trouble was that
the preacher, being naturally of an aggressive nature, lost
sight of his final purpose, and spoiled what might have been a
very effective appeal, by obtruding himself between his illustration
and his audience. It may be of interest to state that
the speaker’s attention was called to this; and he admitted
the justice of the criticism, while disclaiming all knowledge of
what he had done, and how he had done it.</p>

<p>This illustrates the contention. He had had no idea that
he had become so assertive that he virtually said, <em>I</em> tell you so,
on every emphatic word. A study of “Stress” and its
psychology would certainly have helped him.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Orator’s Manual</cite> the author sums up this matter
of radical stress thus: “The radical stress is exerted on
account of a subjective ... motive; in other words, because
a man desires chiefly to express an idea on his own account.... In
[this] case the sound bursts forth abruptly, as if the
man were conscious of nothing but his own organs to prevent
the accomplishment of his object.... It is used whenever
one’s main wish is to express himself so as to be distinctly
understood. In its mildest form, it serves to render articulation
clear and utterance precise; when stronger, it indicates
bold and earnest assurance, positiveness, and dictation.... Without
[this] stress, gentleness becomes an inarticulate
and timid drawl, and vehemence mere brawling bombast.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
With too frequent use of it, one’s delivery becomes characterized
by an appearance of self-assertion, assurance, or preciseness.”
In other words, it is the “I” stress.</p>

<p>Of final stress, Professor Raymond says: “It is exerted on
account of an objective idea. The sound is pushed forth
gradually, as if the man were conscious of outside opposition,
and of the necessity of pressing his point. It is used whenever
one’s main wish is to impress his thoughts on others. It
gives utterance, in its weakest form, to the whine or complaint
of mere peevishness demanding consideration; when stronger
to a pushing earnestness or determination; in its strongest
form, to a desire to cause others to feel one’s own astonishment,
scorn, or horror.... Without final stress there can
be no representation of childish weakness or obstinacy, or of
... resolution; used too exclusively, or excessively, it
causes delivery to be characterized by an appearance of wilfulness,
depriving it of the qualities of persuasion that appeal
to the sympathies.”</p>

<p>A very little of final stress will give a decided coloring to
the delivery. The student should be careful, therefore, not
to overdo it. To illustrate: a speaker is urging the colonists
to abandon the idea of war, claiming that they are weak, and
so on. Patrick Henry rises and says, “Sir, we are <em>not</em> weak
if we make a proper use of those means which the God of
nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people
armed in the holy cause of <em>liberty</em>, and in such a country as
that which <em>we</em> possess, are <em>invincible</em> by <em>any</em> force which our
enemy can send against us.” On the word “not,” the speaker
is plainly pushing aside the argument of his opponent. When
he utters “liberty,” we note again the insistent idea. He
tells us by his stress, Other revolutions may have failed
through lack of numbers, but the gentleman forgets that ours
will be a struggle for liberty. Again, in “we,” “invincible,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and “any,” we plainly discern the idea of overcoming opposition.
Now, it must be clear that while it is only on the five
words italicized we note the insistence, yet the whole statement
is strongly tinged by it.</p>

<p>There is a third form of stress commonly called “Median.”
This is a combination of the final and radical, and manifests a
combination of the objective and subjective states. There are
other combinations and forms of stress, but they are rarely
heard and need not be dwelt upon here.</p>

<p>Attention needs to be directed to the fact that stress
sometimes extends through several words and gives a characteristic
color to an entire phrase or sentence. For instance, we
note that the swell continues from the opening word to
“despised,” in the following speech of Cassio, who is opposing
Iago’s plan. Note further the same effect on phrases
italicized:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will rather sue to be despised, than to deceive so good a commander,
with <em>so slight</em>, <em>so drunken</em>, and <em>so indiscreet</em> an officer.
Drunk! and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and
discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit
of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee&mdash;devil!&mdash;<cite>Othello</cite>,
Act ii., Sc. 3.</p></div>

<p>Observe how the force increases up to “Lord” and dies
away to the end in the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>It may be well to remark here that there are certain writers
who hold that the study of stress is misleading, or at best
useless. To these answer is made that music uses these
stresses very much in the sense in which they are used here.
The attack necessary for pure singing or instrumental tone is
our radical (normal) stress. The “staccato” and “sforzando”
are more intense forms of this stress. The “crescendo,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“diminuendo,” and “swell” are respectively equivalent to
“final,” prolonged “radical,” and “median” stresses.</p>

<p>It may be well to call attention to a very general confusion
of ideas in the use of the word “low.” It is applied to force
and pitch indiscriminately, to the loss of an important distinction.
Low pitch is the result of low tension, while soft force
is diminished mental energy. High pitch may accompany soft
force, and loud force may be simultaneous with low pitch. It
is because low pitch has generally accompanied soft force that
the confusion has arisen.</p>

<h4>PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS.</h4>

<p>These aspects, having been dwelt upon at some length in the
preceding discussion, may be dismissed with a few words.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The knowledge of the psychology of Force and Stress is to
serve as a standard of criticism, not as a foundation for
mechanical drills. There is a school of reading pedagogy,
with lamentably extended sway, that argues, since there are
found various kinds of stress in our speech, therefore we must
drill our pupils on these. Nothing could be farther from the
truth. Stress denotes a state of mind. If our philosophy of
stress is sound, it should teach us that the mental state finds
instinctive expression in one form of stress or another, and
consequently we must get the state before we can get the stress.
We might add that this is true of Time, Pitch, and Quality,
as well as of Stress.</p>

<p>Do not tell a child to read louder. If you do, you will get
loudness&mdash;that awful, grating schoolboy loudness&mdash;without a
particle of expression in it. Many a child reads well, but is
bashful. When we tell him to read louder, he braces himself
for the effort and kills the quality, which is the finer breath
and spirit of oral expression, and gives us a purely physical
thing&mdash;force. Put your weak-voiced readers on the platform;
let them face the class and talk to you, seated in the middle
of the room, and you will get all the force you need. On the
whole, we have too much force rather than too little. Let
the teacher learn that we want quality, not quantity, and our
statement of the mental action behind force will be of much
benefit in creating the proper conditions.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF THE READER</span></h3>


<p>In our knowledge of the psychology of the elements of
expression, we have the solution of the difficulties resulting
from the complexity and intangibility of vocal expression.
The teacher now knows what to look for, and hence is enabled
to diagnose the case. There is now the second step to be
taken in the development of the teacher: he must have
method. It can hardly be claimed that there is any definite
progression in our instruction. In the primary grades, the
pupils learn the letters, their sounds, and a meagre amount
of expression. After that the teaching is haphazard. This is
not the case with arithmetic or history, or geography; why
should it be so in reading? The answer is clear. For many
reasons, not difficult to ascertain, the child has a vague idea
that reading is simply vocal utterance; that his work as a
reader is done when he has pronounced the words. This state
of mind may be attributed, first, to his primary training, and,
second, to the perfunctoriness of the reading lesson in the
grammar grades. We seem to be satisfied, in the beginning,
if a pupil learns to recognize and pronounce words. This is a
serious error. We should never for a moment forget that our
purpose in giving pupils the ability to recognize words is to
enable them to extract the thought from the printed page.
Hence, from the outset, as was enjoined in the Introduction,
we should lay the least possible stress upon word-getting, and,
contrariwise, all possible stress on thought-getting. If the
primary teachers should succeed in developing the state of
mind that would cause the pupils to go to the printed page as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
they go to the feet of one who has a story to tell, we should be
willing to ask for nothing else of them as a result of all their
teaching.</p>

<p>But let us accept reading as we find it to-day, and let us
suppose the pupil is about ten or eleven years of age. What
is the first step? To impress upon him that the printed page
is a picture; that it contains ideas, sights, sounds; that it
takes the place of the author, and that he must listen to it as
to the voice of the author. This is the all-important factor.
Many of us think we are following this plan, when, in reality,
we defeat our ends by the way we use the means. We allow
slovenly reading and pass over the grossest carelessness; so
that, unconsciously, the pupil forms the loosest habits of
expression. Then the pupil must be stimulated to hold the
thought; to let it hold him, if you will. This, too, is a very
necessary part of the training. The defective reading of
preachers and authors is not due to the fact that they cannot
get the thought, but that they are not dwelling upon it in
detail while reading. The third stage in the first step is to
train the pupil so that he will never get up to read without
the consciousness that he has something to give. Let the
pupils, and, first of all, the teacher, close their books, and so
give the poor reader some encouragement. Do not have him
read to the backs of the class. How should we like to address
an audience of inexpressive backs? The following of this last
suggestion will produce wonderful results, and quickly too.
But it has another value: it compels the class to think, to follow
the reader, to get thought through the ear (a talent
becoming rarer every day), and, above all, it stimulates the
imagination. Summarized, the first step means, <em>Get the
thought, hold the thought, give the thought</em>. Keep at this for
a month, if necessary.</p>

<p>The one object of this lesson is to impress upon the mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the pupil that words have no meaning unless they stimulate
thought. It is, perhaps, needless to add that the teacher
should be on his guard against teaching inflections and pauses
and the like, as such. No other aim should be held in mind
than that of getting the pupil to see clearly and to express
forcibly.</p>

<p>The teacher should use constantly such criticism as, “Is
that the thought?” or, “Won’t you tell that to me?” This
method will soon set the pupil to thinking. It will gradually
impress upon him the true function of the reading lesson.
There will soon disappear that dreadful perfunctoriness so
characteristic of class-room reading. How much preparation
does the pupil now give to his reading? Practically none.
He prepares those lessons in which he gradually learns he can
be definitely tested: his arithmetic, spelling, composition,
geography. Then, if he has any time, he may look over his
reading lesson to discover if there are any “hard” words, and
when he has mastered these he thinks his work is done. But
let us remember that such preparation is by no means
adequate. There are passages in every lesson which require
patient study, even though each word may be simple. Words
in themselves mean little; it is words in relation that we
must study.</p>

<p>This first step includes all the others. It may be asked
then, “Why are there others?” The subsequent chapters
will deal with this question, but it may be explained here that
the purpose of this first step is to create and make permanent
the proper atmosphere of the reading hour. The criticisms
should be general, not particular, and the teacher should be
careful to offer no discouraging criticism. Every effort should
be made to stimulate the pupil. He should be urged to get
the thought, and especially impressed with the idea that the
class depends upon him for their understanding of the text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Choose selections from all sources&mdash;from the history lesson,
and from the geography lesson. Let these selections be fairly
simple, and above all, vital and interesting. <cite>Barbara Frietchie</cite>,
Longfellow’s <cite>Peace-Pipe</cite> from <cite>Hiawatha</cite>, and Browning’s
<cite>Ride from Ghent to Aix</cite>, or <cite>The Pied Piper</cite>, and even
shorter extracts of prose or poetry, are excellent material.
Give out a dozen of these, let each pupil learn one by heart,
and tell it,&mdash;not declaim it,&mdash;to his classmates.</p>

<p>Let the teacher not worry because this process is slow and
threatens to leave the work outlined for a given term incomplete.
It is not the quantity but the quality we are after.
But by this method we shall in time cover more ground than
we now do in a given period. If we continually offer such
criticism as will impress the pupil that thought-getting is
everything, that reading is but the expression of that thought,
he will go to his history, and geography, and arithmetic lesson
for thought; so that the time spent in the reading hour is
virtually just the training for every other lesson. Finally,
this is the true preparation for the making of sight-readers.
It is true, one should be able to read better after some preparation
than he does at sight; but everyone should be able, by the
time he leaves the public school, to read any ordinary passage
at sight without blundering. The mental attitude formed by
the method urged will cause the student to approach the
printed page warily, prepared to deal with its difficulties, and
will thus produce better reading.</p>

<p>A word to those who ride the sight-reading hobby too hard.
It is only the experienced reader who can read well at sight.
To ask an immature pupil to read at sight is to do one of two
things: if he is timid, it frightens him; if he is a poor reader
it simply fastens the careless habits upon him, by leading him
to believe, by implication, that reading is merely pronunciation.
In the upper grades, there should be sight-reading,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
but only where the previous training has been methodical.
It is well to give the class a chance to read over the selection
for a few minutes before the test is made.</p>

<p>Each teacher must decide for himself how he will develop
the foregoing principles. The following plan, however,
representing the actual work of a teacher before his class, will
be suggestive:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are going to study how to read; and the first thing we must
know is, What is reading?</p>

<p>Now, before we answer this question, let us try to get an answer
to another: What is speaking? Speaking is telling someone what
I am thinking or feeling. So, if you were in the author’s school, he
could tell you the thoughts he has. But you are not, and so he
must write them. Now we are ready to answer the question, What
is reading? Reading is getting thought from the printed or written
page.</p>

<p>Let us go a little further. Suppose a writer wants to say something
to you through the printed page, what does he do? He first
thinks over very carefully what he has to say, and then chooses
and writes the words that will give you his meaning. But remember,
you must study his words and think about them as carefully
as he did when he wrote them.</p>

<p>Have you been attentive so far? Let us see. Can you tell me
what speaking is? what reading is? If you can not, do you not
see you have not been paying attention?</p>

<p>Getting thought from the printed page should be just like
listening carefully to speaking. Yes, you must be more careful in
reading, because the author is not here to explain things to you,
or to repeat his words. You have only the printed words, and if
you do not listen very carefully to what they say, you will not
understand him. Now let us see whether this is clear. Here is a
sentence; can you see what I see? “The next day, which was
Saturday, the king called his generals and some of his friends to the
royal tent, and told them, in a quiet voice, that at daybreak on
Tuesday he was going to return to London and give up the war.”</p>

<p>Now take your eyes off the blackboard and tell us all you saw,
and tell it in just the order the pictures occur on the board. If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
miss any steps, you must read again and again until you see the
whole thought so clearly that it seems real; then I am sure you will
be able to tell it correctly. You need not use my words; just use
your own language.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to take the next step. Read the sentence to
the class so that you make them see just what you see. Be sure
you never forget this.</p>

<p>You must remember that unless you <em>try</em> to make them see the
pictures you have in mind, they will be very likely not to understand
you.</p>

<p>Now, what have we been doing? First, we studied the meaning
of the words; second, we got several pictures; and third, we tried
to give those pictures to others. So we see there are two kinds of
reading: the first for ourselves, the second for others. The first kind
must always go before the second: for if we have nothing in
our mind to tell, how can we give it to others?</p>

<p>Let us remember then, that reading for others is just like talking
to them, and unless we get from the page just the thought the
writer had in mind we cannot give that thought to another. Sometimes
it is not easy to get this thought; but if you will study carefully,
it will become clearer and clearer, until at last it is just as
easy to understand as if it had been your own. I want to give you a
short drill, and then our first lesson will be over. “In the summer
the grass is green, but it turns brown in the fall.” Can you imagine
how green grass looks? how brown grass looks? Do you
notice that fall is the time when grass is brown? Again, “He was
a very tall man, with light, curly hair, tanned skin and blue eyes.
His shoulders were stooped like those of a farmer or of one who has
been digging in the mines.” Close your eyes and then call up the
picture of this man. Do you see him as a real man? Now read
this sentence aloud so that your classmates may get the same
picture that you have.</p>

<p>These are the three things we have learned in our first lesson,
and they are very, very important: We must <em>get</em> the thought; we
must <em>hold</em> the thought; and we must <em>give</em> the thought. This is
reading aloud.</p>

<p>Remember, I want you to be getting these pictures from
everything you read; from your geography lesson, your history
lesson, and even your arithmetic lesson. I am sure you will get
these lessons better than you ever did before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are some interesting stories and parts of stories which you
must tell to the class. Be sure you understand them, and then tell
them so that your classmates will understand them too.</p></div>

<p>In closing this chapter, it should be remarked that the time
to be spent on this and subsequent steps depends upon the
circumstances. In the lower grades more time will be necessary
than in the upper. If the teacher of the eighth grade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
(the highest) wishes to devote some time to teaching reading,
he should make a careful study of the needs of the
class, and then use such of the steps, and in such order, as
are most likely to meet those needs. In the lower classes it
is suggested that the teacher follow in a general way the plan
set forth in this book. About one step a month is all that a
pupil can grasp. After he has the principle, let the teacher
take up the regular reading lesson, laying special stress upon
the principles already covered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>It is believed that the reading lessons contained in this series
are the first attempt to present in an orderly and philosophic
manner the difficulties the pupils have in learning to read.</p>

<p>There is very little doubt that the reading lesson hardly pays for
the time spent upon it. All authorities are agreed that, except in
rare cases, pupils do not read any better at the end of the school year
than they do at the beginning, except that they may pronounce
with a little more facility or are possessed of a somewhat wider
vocabulary. In many class rooms, reading becomes a lesson in
composition, spelling, definition, and the like.</p>

<p>The method in vogue in certain districts of telling pupils about
Inflections, and Time, and Kinds of Emphasis, is certainly faulty.
On the other hand, very little more progress has been made by
those who, in a very general and vague manner, tell the pupil to
get the thought. As a result of the methods heretofore in use, it has
been found impossible for the teacher in any given grade to determine
how much real knowledge of reading a pupil has who has
just been promoted from a lower grade.</p>

<p>In the lessons here presented, it is impressed upon the pupil not
only that he must get the thought, but he is shown how to get it.
The various difficulties of reading are presented one at a time, and
further, are so graded that the least difficult shall precede the more
complex. It is well known that the reading lesson, as a reading
lesson, gets little or no preparation by the pupils. By the method
here laid down careful preparation is a necessity; and the lesson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which, as a rule, is very ill prepared, may now be studied at home
with a very definite object in view, and more important still, the
pupil can be held responsible for definite results.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the young pupil knows nothing of
inflections, emphasis, etc., and cares still less about them. While
the teacher may be thoroughly conversant with the whole range
of vocal technique in reading, he should try to avoid the use of
technical terms with the pupils, especially with the younger ones.
This is the very essence of the present method, which is based upon
a well-established psychological law: If the thought is right, the
expression will be right. Talking to pupils about technique, only
confuses them and in many cases results in gross affectations. The
mind is taken from the thought to the form of its expression. We
must remember that shyness, and other forms of self-consciousness
(which so often mar the reading) are really but signs that the
pupil’s mental action is awry. The reading may be more quickly
and more permanently improved by eradicating the self-consciousness
than by resorting to technical drills. Make the pupil <em>want to
read</em>, and the chances are strongly in favor of his losing self-consciousness.</p>

<p>While it is not possible in the space allotted the author of these
articles to give the fullest possible instruction, yet these lessons will
serve a definite purpose by presenting to the pupils, in a rational
order, the various difficulties everyone has to overcome in learning
to read. There may be certain phases of technique that a teacher
may miss in this series of lessons, but it is certain, that if they are
carefully taught, the pupils will improve not only along the particular
line laid down in each lesson, but along the whole line of
reading in general.</p>

<p>This method is introduced in the hope that the measure of a
pupil’s progress will not be gauged by the number of selections he
reads in a given period. It is better to prepare carefully and philosophically
six or eight lessons in one-half of the school year, than to
endeavor to cover three times as many in the usual hurried fashion.
The teacher may be sure that when the first six or eight lessons are
thus carefully prepared, the progress thereafter will be more rapid.
There is no doubt that the pupil who will spend two years in this
graded work will be able to read any ordinary selection with ease,
and with pleasure to the listener.</p>

<p>It is urged (1) that the teacher use additional examples under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
each new principle, in order that the pupil may have the principle
impressed upon him by selecting new examples for himself and by
reading them aloud in class; (2) that the same lesson be repeated
as many times, with the same or new illustrations, as may be
necessary to assure the teacher that the class has thoroughly
grasped the spirit of the lesson; and (3) that the teacher insist
upon most careful and adequate preparation. So, and so only, can
we hope to teach reading.</p>

<p>The main objects of the first lessons are two. First; to develop
what may be termed the logical side of reading; in other words,
the intellectual side. The greatest stress should be laid on getting
the sense, which is, of course, the basis of all reading. The
emotional side need not be altogether neglected, but should be
always subsidiary to the intellectual. If the teacher succeed in
getting the expression <em>vital</em>, nothing more should be expected. To
get the sense and to express it with earnestness is the first step.
Second; the teacher is urged not to follow mechanically the order
of the general reading lessons. If Lesson XX offer a better
opportunity than, let us say, Lesson X for illustrating the principle
laid down in any of the special lessons, the former should be used,
no matter what the preceding general lesson may have been. The
teacher should be acquainted with the pedagogical possibilities of
all the general lessons, and should use such, irrespective of their
place in the book, as are best adapted at the moment to assist the
pupils in mastering the principle in any given special reading lesson.
I have found much good in keeping a little note book on the
following plan: I give a page to each of the steps, and every
example I come across, no matter in what book&mdash;history, geography,
reader&mdash;is noted. Thus:</p>

<p class="p2" />
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdc" colspan="3">EXAMPLES OF CONTRAST.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl pad3">Book.</td><td class="tdc">Page.</td><td class="tdc">Paragraph.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;’s History,</td><td class="tdc">250</td><td class="tdc">3</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;’s &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “</td><td class="tdc">109</td><td class="tdc">1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Reader (3)</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp; 87</td><td class="tdc">8</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">In this way, the teacher has always plenty of illustrative matter
on hand.</p>

<p>While not in entire sympathy with the method that compels
teachers to cover a certain number of reading lessons in a given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
time, yet I am sensible that it would be useless to attempt to
change all this at once. Recognizing the futility of such an effort,
I advise the teacher to conform to this arbitrary and unscientific
method until the community is educated to the newer method.
The best results may be obtained, under the circumstances, by
following some such plan as this: Begin with the first special lesson
as soon as possible. Then, having dwelt on that as long as necessary,
pass to the regular reading lessons, bearing in mind that
until the second special lesson, the principle of the first should be
constantly reiterated. For the entire time (say a month) between
the first and second special lessons let the teacher revert to the
former again and again. Let the corrections be made over and
over by asking such questions as, “Is that the way you would say
it if you were talking?” or, “You are not trying to make us see
the picture,” and so on. After the second special lesson has been
taken up in class, and before the third, the endeavor of a teacher
should be to enforce the principles of the first two lessons. This
plan should be kept up until the last lesson has been taught.</p></div>

<span class="fs60">GROUPING</span></h3>


<p>If the work of the first step has been carefully done, the
transition to the second step will present few difficulties. As
a matter of fact, the pupil has been grouping unconsciously,
but in a way more or less uncertain. The purpose of the next
step is to fix firmly the habit of grouping. As a general rule,
the pupil pronounces as many words in one group as his eye
can take in and his voice utter; consequently, his reading is
choppy and often meaningless.</p>

<p>At the outset care should be exercised in the choice of
extracts. Any extract will not do. Simple passages, with
simple ideas, are needed. Avoid complex, involved, inverted
rhetoric. Later on, when proper habits have been formed,
the difficulties may be increased; but we shall meet only with
discouragement if we introduce them too soon. The following
is just difficult enough to bring out the efforts of an ordinary
child of ten or eleven:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once upon a time there lived a very rich man, and a king besides,
whose name was Midas; and he had a little daughter, whom nobody
but myself ever heard of, and whose name I either never knew, or
have entirely forgotten. So, because I love odd names for little
girls, I choose to call her Marygold.&mdash;<cite>The Golden Touch.</cite> <span class="smcap">Hawthorne.</span></p></div>

<p>The teacher should use a great many isolated extracts.
These may not be so interesting as entire selections, but if
chosen carefully and read with a definite object, it is surprising
how they hold the attention of the class. It may also be possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to find short stories to supplement the extracts. Many
good extracts may be found in the reader or even in some of
the other books the children are using.</p>

<p>The reason for urging this plan is that few reading books
present the difficulties of reading, in a rational, graded manner.
Any selection may contain the simplest problem and the
most difficult in one paragraph. The pupil must be trained
to get his ideas from the printed page in groups, and such
training can surely be gained better by using carefully selected
passages than by the present aimless wandering among a
labyrinth of words. It is admitted that a good teacher of
reading may be able to get along without calling the attention
of the class to grouping as a definite step; but he must certainly
have that step in mind as part of the development of a
reader.</p>

<p>In this lesson we begin exercises in what might be called
“mental technique.” It must be borne in mind that these
lessons are planned with the object of presenting one element
at a time, and the pupil must not be expected to read well
where he has had no previous drill. In this lesson, therefore,
the pupil should be held responsible for what he has learned
in the first and second lessons only. It must further be
remembered that all corrections should be made by putting
such questions as, “Is that the whole picture?” or, “Have
you not given us more than one picture?” Never tell a pupil
to make a pause here or a pause there, or to read faster or
more slowly. Such corrections are useless. We must learn
to rely upon the thinking to govern the rate of speed, or the
length and frequency of the pauses.</p>

<p>It might be well to bear in mind that in colloquial speech
pauses are less frequent. In other words, the groups are
longer.</p>

<p>As a result of such training as the pupil gets in this lesson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
we shall note that he will learn to look ahead, and so rid himself
of the too general tendency to utter words as soon as he
sees them, regardless of the sense. The process of recognizing
words and pronouncing them simultaneously is attended with
no small amount of danger. It begets a fatal facility in reading
that is a positive detriment to the pupil. There are thousands
who read glibly and yet are utterly ignorant of the
meaning of what they read. To prevent the formation of
such a habit or to break it up where it already exists, there is
no better plan than that herein advocated for the study of
grouping. It need hardly be said that the method of telling
a pupil “to pause before a relative pronoun, inverted adjectives,
prepositional phrases,” and the like, is virtually useless.
The thought, and not the grammatical construction, determines
the pause.</p>

<p>Another suggestive lesson for the teaching of grouping is
offered:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You remember that in our last lesson we learned that we must
first get the thought before we could read. Now we are to study
how to get the thought.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice how you think? If you hear the word
“Car,” what do you think of? Some, of a horse car, some, of an
electric car, and some, of a steam car. So you see the word “Car”
by itself does not give us a very clear picture. The words, “I
saw,” do not mean very much either. For unless we know what you
saw we get nothing to think about. The two words “in a” do not
mean much, and by this time you know why.</p>

<p>Let us put all these words together and add a word or two: “I
saw a man in a steam car.” Now we have a clear picture. What
do we learn from this? We learn that a single word does not give
us a clear picture, and that it takes three, and four, and sometimes
many words, to give us a picture. We can think “I saw a man” or
“in a steam car,” but we get a complete thought only when we
put these two groups of words together. We notice also that
while it takes just a moment to see a picture, it often takes many
words to describe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>What we have done is called grouping; that is, reading several
words together just as we read the syllables of a word. Let us try
some examples. “Charles gave a sled to his brother.” Here there
are two groups: One ending at “sled,” the other, at “brother.” “I
went to King Street with my sister to buy a new hat.” Here we
have three groups. Can you pick them out?</p>

<p>The last thing we are to learn in this lesson is that every group
of words has a picture in it, and that we must not read aloud any
word until we have got the thought or the picture in the group.</p>

<p>Pick out the groups in the following sentence, and then read
aloud, but be sure you pay attention to the picture in each group:
“When-our-school-closes for-the-summer-vacation, some-of-us-go-to-the-country,
others-go-to-the-lakes, some-go-to-the-mountains, and-many
stay-in-the-city.”</p>

<p>For to-morrow’s lesson<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I want you to bring in the groups in the
following examples, putting hyphens between the words of each
group, just as we did in the sentence about the summer vacation.</p></div>


    <div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p class="p4" />

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<span class="fs60">SUCCESSION OF IDEAS</span></h3>


<p>The next step is but a very short one in advance of the
second, and yet one of exceeding importance. It deals with
the succession of ideas. Every long sentence is made up of
small phrases more or less intimately connected. The inflection
denotes this connection. If several phrases point forward
to a thought further on, the end of each of these will be
marked by a rising inflection; if any one of the phrases be
of sufficient importance to demand particular emphasis, its
end will be marked by the falling inflection.</p>

<p>As was said in Chapter II, the reading of a long sentence
presents great difficulties for the child. He loses himself in
the maze of words, and his mental condition is clearly shown
in his melody, which drifts about here and there, like a rudderless
ship. It is the purpose of this step to train him in the
development of his powers of continuous thinking; to enable
him to keep in mind the main idea, no matter how numerous
the details. This step and that dealing with subordinate
ideas have much the same object in view.</p>

<p>The following excerpt from the <cite>Introduction to The Song
of Hiawatha</cite> is a good illustration of a sentence in which the
sense is suspended through many lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles</p>
<p class="verse0">Through the green lanes of the country,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the tangled barberry-bushes</p>
<p class="verse0">Hang their tufts of crimson berries</p>
<p class="verse0">Over stone walls gray with mosses,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pause by some neglected graveyard,</p>
<p class="verse0">For a while to muse, and ponder</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">On a half-effaced inscription,</p>
<p class="verse0">Written with little skill of song-craft,</p>
<p class="verse0">Homely phrases, but each letter</p>
<p class="verse0">Full of hope and yet of heart-break,</p>
<p class="verse0">Full of all the tender pathos</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the Here and the Hereafter;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Stay and read this rude inscription,</p>
<p class="verse0">Read this Song of Hiawatha!</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is in sentences like the following that the pupil is likely
to fail. Speaking of rain, the poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">How it clatters along the roofs,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like the tramp of hoofs!</p>
<p class="verse0">How it gushes and struggles out</p>
<p class="verse0">From the throat of the overflowing spout!</p>
</div></div>

<p>There may be some justification for the falling inflection
on “roofs”; there can be no doubt that the same inflection
would be incorrect on “out.” And yet, the very structure of
the verse would be likely to cause the careless reader to read
it with that very inflection. This is a typical case, and, if
this point has been made clear, one that should be very helpful
to the teacher. The following passage, from the same poem,
affords another exercise in succession of ideas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">In the country, on every side,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where far and wide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like a leopard’s tawny and spotted hide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Stretches the plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">To the dry grass and the drier grain</p>
<p class="verse0">How welcome is the rain!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Let us observe that the plain does not stretch to the dry
grass. There will be a falling inflection on “plain,” and a
rising on “grain.”</p>

<p>The pause has nothing to do with succession of ideas. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would make little difference how long the pause after “plain”
if it were read with a rising inflection. This principle must
never be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Pupils who should know better frequently make mistakes
of the kind we have been discussing, in reading the following
passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">In the furrowed land</p>
<p class="verse0">The toilsome and patient oxen stand;</p>
<p class="verse0">Lifting the yoke-encumbered head,</p>
<p class="verse0">With their dilated nostrils spread,</p>
<p class="verse0">They silently inhale</p>
<p class="verse0">The clover-scented gale,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the vapors that arise</p>
<p class="verse0">From the well-watered and smoking soil.</p>
<p class="verse0">For this rest in the furrow after toil</p>
<p class="verse0">Their large and lustrous eyes</p>
<p class="verse0">Seem to thank the Lord,</p>
<p class="verse0">More than man’s spoken word.</p>
<p><ins><hr class="r30" /></ins></p>
<p class="verse0">Near at hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">From under the sheltering trees,</p>
<p class="verse0">The farmer sees</p>
<p class="verse0">His pastures, and his fields of grain.</p>
<p class="verse0">As they bend their tops</p>
<p class="verse0">To the numberless beating drops</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the incessant rain.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The following extracts from <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite> are within
the comprehension of fairly young children, and will afford
good practice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the northeast
of Lilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel eight hundred
yards wide.</p>

<p>2. I had not yet seen it, and, upon this notice of a intended invasion,
I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of being
discovered by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no intelligence
of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an
embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.</p>

<p>3. I walked toward the northeast coast, over against Blefuscu,
where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective
glass and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of
about fifty men-of-war and a great number of transports. I then
came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant)
for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron.
The cable was about as thick as pack-thread, and the bars of the
length and size of a knitting-needle.</p>

<p>4. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same
reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the
extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many
cables, I went back to the northeast coast, and putting off my
coat, shoes and stockings, walked into the sea in my leathern
jerkin, about half an hour before high water. I waded with what
haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt
ground.</p>

<p>5. When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out
the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of
the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as I have
formerly mentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and, waiting
about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded through the
middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput.</p>

<p>6. The emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting
the issue of this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward
in a large half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to
my breast in water. When I advanced to the middle of the channel,
they were yet more in pain, because I was under water to my
neck. The emperor concluded me to be drowned, and that the
enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner.</p>

<p>7. But he was soon eased of his fears; for, the channel growing
shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing,
and, holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened,
I cried in a loud voice, “Long live the most puissant King of Lilliput!”
This great prince received me at my landing with all possible
encomiums, and created me a <em>nardac</em> upon the spot, which is
the highest title of honor among them.</p></div>

<p>It need hardly be noted that there are many examples of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
momentary completeness in the preceding passages; as, for
instance:</p>

<p>“Lilliput,” in paragraph one.</p>

<p>“Ships,” in paragraph two.</p>

<p>“Anchor,” in paragraph three.</p>

<p>“Arrival,” in paragraph five.</p>

<p>“Me,” “pain,” in paragraph six.</p>

<p>“Spot,” in paragraph seven.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the purpose of this step is to draw the
pupil’s attention to two possibilities in every sentence: Does
the phrase point forward, or is it momentarily complete?
Great care must be observed not to confuse him with statements
regarding inflections.</p>

<p>Momentary completeness has been so fully discussed in a
preceding chapter that it need not be dwelt upon further.</p>

<p>The following lesson-talk may be helpful for the teacher:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Read to yourself this little sentence: “Robert has a slate.” Is
that a complete picture? You see that it is. Now read this sentence:
“Robert has a slate and a pencil.” Here you note that
Robert has two things, so the sentence is not complete when we
come to the word “slate.” Although we have a clear picture, yet
we have not the whole picture. How do we know this? In the
first sentence there was a period after “slate,” but in the second
sentence there was none, and because there wasn’t, we kept on reading
and found there was another group of words giving us the picture
of something else Robert had. Now this teaches us that if we
want to read just as we speak, we must be careful to get not only
one picture or two, but all the pictures in the sentence.</p>

<p>Let me show you how we often make mistakes in our reading
because we don’t pay attention to what I have just shown you.
Suppose we have this sentence: “I saw a cat, and a mouse, and a
rat.” Now, some pupils are careless and they read, “I saw a cat,”
just as if that were the whole sentence. Then they look a little
further and see the next group, “and a mouse,” and they read
that. Then they see the rest of the sentence, “and a rat,” and they
read that. But we know that is not the way to read. We must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
first read the whole sentence silently until we get the picture in
each group, and then we shall be sure to read the sentence just as
one of us would speak it if he really saw the cat, the rat, and the
mouse, at the same time.</p>

<p>Here is a very good example for you to study. Read it through
slowly and carefully, and do not try to read it aloud until you see
clearly the picture in each group. If you do as I ask, you will get
a complete picture of the way in which the young soldier prepares
to go out to battle:</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">But when the gray dawn stole into his tent,</p>
<p class="verse0">He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">And took his horseman’s cloak, and left his tent.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Can you not see the young warrior rising from his couch, dressing
himself, girding on his sword, and so forth? If you can, then
I am sure you will be able to make others see it as a complete
picture, without breaking it up into many little pieces, just as we
used to do in the first book. You see, he did not rise and stop; and
then dress himself and stop; and gird his sword and stop; but one
action followed the other, just as each car in a long, moving train,
follows another. Each car is like a group of words, and the whole
train is like the complete sentence.</p></div>

<span class="fs60">THE CENTRAL IDEA</span></h3>


<p>A little reflection must make it manifest that every sentence,
or even phrase, has a central idea. When this idea is
brought out in vocal expression it is by means of some form of
emphasis, such as inflection or force or time, and so forth.
The exact form of the manifestation need not concern us
here.</p>

<p>Now that the pupils have been trained to look for the
thought, the average sentence will take care of itself as far as
the leading idea is concerned; but it must be admitted that
in the sentence of more than average difficulty we find much
obscure and more faulty reading, due, no doubt, to ignorance
of the central idea. It is perhaps not wise in all cases to teach
this step, as a step, to pupils under eleven years; but when it
is taught, great care must be exercised to keep the class from
forming the habit of pounding out every important word. Be
this as it may, the attention of teachers should be directed to
the great importance of such studies as are included in the
present chapter. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that the
step may be undertaken in the higher grades and in high
schools to great advantage.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no more severe test of the student’s
apprehension of the meaning than his emphasis&mdash;using that
term in its broadest sense. Determining the central idea
is essentially a logical process; the student weighs and
determines the value of every word, and by a process of
elimination finally fixes upon the exact thought to be conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Rules for emphasis so commonly given are, comparatively,
of little value. If the student has the thought, his emphasis
may be trusted to take care of itself; where he has not, the
rules are confusing and misleading. Mr. Alfred Ayres says
facetiously, but truly, “There is only one rule for emphasis&mdash;Gumption.”</p>

<p>It is understood that emphasis has a much wider meaning
than that of merely making a word stand out distinctly by
means of force; it includes any manner of making a thought
prominent. What we are here studying is simply that form
of emphasis which is manifested by inflection or force, or
both. The central idea in colloquial utterance is generally
made significant through force; but by far the most suggestive
method, when occasion requires, is through inflection.
Of course, these two are very often combined in various proportions.</p>

<p>In the following illustrations, two classes of examples will
be noticed. In the first, the central ideas are indicated by
means of italics and capitals. It is not claimed that some
other interpretation might not be possible; but that suggested
is at least justifiable. The teacher will study these examples
carefully with the object of determining the reason for the
marking. In the second list of illustrations, the teacher
himself will determine the central idea, and manifest it
through his rendition.</p>

<p>By following this plan, the teacher’s own reading will
show much improvement, and he will probably learn better
how to work out the problem with his classes.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that we have no recognized symbols
for showing shades and degrees of emphasis. The
teacher will, no doubt, be able to determine for himself
whether the element of force or that of inflection predominates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseqq"><a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>There on the dais sat another king</p>

<p class="verse10">
&mdash;<cite>King Robert of Sicily.</cite> <span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Note that “his” and “robes” are of about equal importance,
the former perhaps weighing a little heavier than the
latter. In the next phrase the inflection on “his” is much
narrower than on the first “his,” while the “crown” becomes
more important. Finally, the last “his” has no emphasis,
while the climax of thought and emotion is reached on
“signet-ring.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">And do you NOW put on your <em>best attire</em>!</p>
<p class="verse0">And do you <span class="fs70">NOW</span> cull out a <span class="fs70">HOLIDAY</span>?</p>
<p class="verse0">And do you now STREW FLOWERS in HIS way</p>
<p class="verse0">That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?</p>

<p class="verse12">
&mdash;<cite>Julius Caesar</cite>, Act i., Sc. 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note the climax: “best attire” is weaker than “holiday,”
and it than the strewing of flowers. Conversely, the
emphasis on “now” diminishes at each repetition. The context
should be carefully digested.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I rather tell thee what is to <em>be fear’d</em></p>
<p class="verse0">Than what I <em>fear</em>.</p>

<p class="verse10">
&mdash;<cite>Julius Caesar</cite>, Act i., Sc. 2.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An actor (?) was once heard to read the above passage,
putting his emphasis on “thee” and the second “I.” How
illuminating!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">If ’twere <em>done</em> when ’tis <em>done</em>, then ’twere well</p>
<p class="verse0">It were done quickly.</p>

<p class="verse16">
&mdash;<cite>Macbeth</cite>, Act i., Sc. 7.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The above is a fine illustration of the claim that the study
of the “Central Idea” is essentially a logical process. Any
other emphasis is puerile, and yet every other emphasis is
heard except this. Let us look a little closer. The passage
beginning with this line resolves itself into this: I am hampered
with doubts and fears; I can find no rest by day or night
until I kill the king or resolve to abandon the attempt. But
if I can be assured that there shall be no after consequences
here, I’ll risk the life to come. Hence, the following paraphrase
is the equivalent of the first line: If it [the murder]
were out of people’s minds, if it were blotted out of recollection,
consigned to oblivion, when it is committed [when I do
the murder], then the sooner it is done the better for my peace
of mind. In a word, if it is all <em>over</em> when it is <em>committed</em>,
“then ’twere well it were done quickly.” Many purposely
avoid repeating the emphasis on “done” because they believe
the two “done’s” are identical in meaning. Nothing could be
farther from the truth, as shown above. The truth is, this
line is one of those grim plays upon words in which Shakespeare
is so prolific. It need hardly be added that when
properly read the sense will be made clear by keeping in mind
the paraphrase just given. The result will be that the first
“done” will be read with a very decided falling inflection,
and the second with a rising circumflex inflection (the mind
looking forward at the end to the conclusion of the sentence).
Perhaps to the sensitive student of literature there is another
argument. Shakespeare’s vocabulary would indeed have been
very limited had he found it necessary to use three “done’s”
in the opening line of a most important soliloquy. To one
who is alive to æsthetic effects, the very fact that Shakespeare
does use them suggests a more careful analysis, and one soon
discovers the cause. The play on the words makes the salient
idea more striking.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This example is used in Fulton and Trueblood’s <cite>Practical
Elocution</cite>. The authors state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been a question with the actors which word of the phrase
<em>heart of heart</em> should receive the chief emphasis, some claiming the
reading should be “<em>heart</em> of heart,” others “heart <em>of</em> heart,” still
others “heart of <em>heart</em>.” The first seems to us the preferable
reading, for if the lines read, “I will wear him in my heart’s core,
ay, in the <em>center</em> of it,” the case would be clear. Here “center”
stands in the place of the first “heart.”</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">She looked down to blush and she looked up to sigh,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a <em>smile</em> on her <em>lip</em> and a <em>tear</em> in her <em>eye</em>.</p>

<p class="right">
&mdash;<cite>Lochinvar.</cite> <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>There are those who argue that “lip” and “eye” should
not be emphasized. This is a serious error. The phrases
“on her lip” and “in her eye” are elaborative, and hence the
emphasis is distributed over the entire phrase. If this is
wrong, we must blame the writer for tautology. But literature
has many similar examples. Here is another:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him: and put a <em>ring</em> on
his <em>hand</em>, and <em>shoes</em> on his <em>feet</em>.&mdash;<cite>Luke</cite> xv. 22.</p></div>

<p>There is a rule telling us to emphasize words in antithesis.
In many cases we do so; but these cases would emphasize
themselves, so to speak. There are, however, many cases of
rhetorical antithesis where it interferes with the sense to
emphasize both members of the antithesis, and here the rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
steps in to lead astray the pupil. To illustrate: “I am going
to town to-morrow, but <em>you</em> need not go until the day <em>after</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. A. Melville Bell has put this very clearly. In his
<cite>Essays and Postscripts on Elocution</cite>, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The emphasis of contrast falls necessarily on the second of a
contrasted pair of words, but not necessarily on the first. The first
word is emphatic or otherwise, according as it is new, or implied
in preceding thoughts; but it is not emphatic in virtue of subsequent
contrast. A purposed anticipation may give emphasis to
the first word, but such anticipatory emphasis should not be made
habitual.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the bright blood that fills my veins, transmitted free from
godlike ancestry, were like the slimy ooze which stagnates in your
arteries, I had remained at home.</p></div>

<p>Is it not clear that the anticipatory emphasis on “my” is
not only unnecessary, but would, if given, weaken the force of
the succeeding phrase?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have nothing more to say, but the honorable <em>gentleman</em> will no

comfortingly, Affairs are balanced, then, etc. The entire

<p>Suggestions for a class lesson follow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let us look at the following sentence: “I heard William say
it.” Can you read that sentence now? I should say you could
not, and my reason is, that you are not quite sure of its meaning.
Let us see what that meaning is.</p>

<p>One person might mean that <em>he</em> had heard William say it, but that
<em>you</em> had not. How would you read the sentence then? Another
person might mean, “I am <em>sure</em> William said it, for I was there to
hear him.” How would you express that? Again, a third person
might mean that he was sure <em>George</em> or <em>John</em> had not said it,
but <em>William</em>. How would you read that?</p>

<p>We learn from this another reason why we must use great care
in preparing our reading lesson. You see, if we do not, we shall
not stop to consider just what the sentence means, and then in
reading we shall not express the author’s meaning. Let us try a
few more examples. In each make up your mind just what you
want to say, and then say it as if you meant it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example 1.</span>&mdash;“I like geography better than I do history.”
Now, if you have been talking to a friend about the studies you
like best, and he has just said, “I like geography as well as I do
history,” how would you read the above example? Of course, you
see that the main idea in your mind would be to tell him that
you liked geography not only as well as, but better than, history.
Well then, now you may read the example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example 2.</span>&mdash;“I should rather be a lawyer than a doctor.”
Suppose in this case a friend has said, “My father wants me to be a
doctor.” How would you then read the sentence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example 3.</span>&mdash;“Queen Victoria has reigned longer than any
other monarch who ever sat upon the English throne.” Suppose
you are telling this to your classmates, and that you have not been
talking about Queen Victoria before, but you want only to give
them a piece of information.</p>

<p>Let us remember, then, that every sentence has a principal, or,
as we sometimes say, a central idea. We need be extremely careful
to get that central idea, and if we have been, we notice that
certain words will stand out very prominently in our reading. This
is true because reading is just like speaking. If some one asks you
where you are going, and you are going to school, what do you
think of? You don’t think of each word of your answer; you think
only one idea&mdash;school. So you say, “I am going to school,” and you
make the word “school” very prominent, or important. “School”
is the central idea.</p>

<p>Until our next step I want you to study every sentence of every
reading lesson, bearing in mind this very important fact regarding
the central idea. Every sentence has such a central idea, and until
you have found it you cannot read the sentence.</p></div>

<p>Very few directions are necessary except to warn the
teacher against speaking about the various <em>kinds</em> of emphasis.
No matter what the kind, the thought will find its natural
channel if the conditions be right. It is true, that sometimes
a word is made prominent by inflection (rising, falling, circumflex),
sometimes by slower time, sometimes by force alone.
But let us remember, these various forms are the results of
various forms of thinking. If those are right, correct reading
will follow.</p>

<p>It is further worth noting that the best authorities use
“emphasis” as signifying any means of making the thought
stand out. Hence, the teacher is urged not to use the term
“emphasis” at all. If a pupil err, tell him he has not given
you the central, or leading, idea.</p>

<span class="fs60">SUBORDINATION</span></h3>


<p>The analysis for determining the central idea must have
led the student to discern subordinate ideas. As a rule, the
expression of these will not be difficult, but there are certain
phases of subordination that require special study. We have
noted that in our desire to impress the leading thought upon
another we have used significant inflection, or force or time.
It must follow then that the relatively unimportant words
will be read in a manner less striking. In the following
speech of Portia, observe how naturally we slight the relatively
unimportant ideas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If to <span class="fs120">do</span> were as easy as to know what were <span class="fs120">good</span> to do, <span class="fs120">chapels</span>
had been <span class="fs120">churches</span>, and <span class="fs120">poor</span> men’s <span class="fs120">cottages princes’ palaces</span>.
It is a <span class="fs120">good divine</span> that follows his <span class="fs120">own instructions</span>: I can easier
teach <span class="fs120">twenty</span> what were <span class="fs120">good</span> to be <span class="fs120">done</span>, than to be <span class="fs120">one</span> of the
twenty to <span class="fs120">follow</span> mine own teaching.</p></div>

<p>There will be degrees of subordination, of course: the
above marking is meant only to draw attention to the purely
instinctive process as a result of which the vocal modulations
manifest the relative degrees of thought value.</p>

<p>It is something of an art to touch lightly upon the unimportant
and yet not to slur it. We are not advocating that the
teacher should at any length dwell upon this, though it is well
for him to recognize this feature of expression. There are
two reasons for this: first, in the earlier stages of reading
there is a tendency to overemphasize; second, in the later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
stages, the unimportant words are hurried, with the result
that the reading becomes indistinct.</p>

<p>As there are slighted words in every phrase, so there are
slighted phrases and clauses in many sentences. We are all
acquainted with the time-honored advice concerning the
manner in which one should read words in parentheses:
“Lower the voice and read faster.” It is not to be denied
that the average parenthetical thought is expressed in that
way, but there are many examples in which the injunction will
not apply. Whether the key will be raised or lowered, and
whether the time will be accelerated or retarded, will depend
entirely upon the mental attitude of the reader. To illustrate:
“The battle of Waterloo,&mdash;the most important battle
of the nineteenth century,&mdash;ended the career of Napoleon.”
If one has been speaking of the great importance of this
battle, and takes for granted that his audience recognizes this
importance, he will probably lower the key in the subordinate
sentence, and read it faster; but otherwise he would read
it more slowly (as a result of the importance of the
thought), even if he did not raise the key. This leads us to
the conclusion that a phrase or clause may be grammatically
subordinate and yet of the greatest importance. The degree
of importance determines how it shall be read, and not arbitrary
rules. The main result to be obtained in this step is the
training of the student’s mind in apprehending thought-modulation;
to enable him to weigh the thought in order that
he may perceive more clearly the relative values of the various
phrases. This perception leads in expression to that most
desirable phase of utterance&mdash;variety.</p>

<p>A few simple illustrations are added as examples of what
may be used for class drill. The more difficult illustrations
may be used for advanced classes, and for practice by the
teacher himself:</p>

<p>However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted
them very gently, and set them down again in two great wicker
baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they might
not break; and, as between the pot and the basket there was a
little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw;
and these two pots, being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.</p>

<p>Though I succeeded so poorly in my design for large pots, yet I

advice of his dearest friends, in opposition to stern paternal commands,
against every dictate of worldly wisdom and human prudence,
in spite of all the dazzling temptations of ambition so

broad fair highway to wealth, position, and distinction, that the
hands of a king opened before him, and, casting his lot with the
sect weakest and most unpopular in England, through paths that
were tangled with trouble, and lined with pitiless thorns of
persecution, he walked into honor and fame, and the reverence of
the world, such as royalty could not promise and could not give

<p>In the illustrations that follow, the student will note three
distinct degrees of importance of thought; in other words,
there is the main idea, its modifier, and the modifier of the
modifier. The vocal expression of these illustrations will be
affected just to the extent that the student appreciates the
value of the different phrases.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is my purpose, therefore, believing that there are certain
points of superiority in modern artists, and especially in one or
two of their number, which have not yet been fully understood,
except by those who are scarcely in a position admitting the declaration
of their conviction, to institute a close comparison between
the great works of ancient and modern landscape art.</p></div>

<p>Many students who find no difficulty in silently reading
such extracts as the above, will often fail in their vocal
expression because of the fact that the latter is more deliberate;
and consequently they may lose the trend of the main
thought in rendering the explanatory and parenthetical portions.
To overcome this difficulty, they are advised to read
the sentence, with the omission of all but the most essential
idea; then let them add one idea after another to the main idea,
until the sentence is read correctly in its entirety. In the last
example quoted, the main idea is, “It is my purpose ... to
institute a close comparison between the great works of
ancient and modern landscape art.” Read this three or four
times, until the idea is clearly apprehended. Now read the
sentence, omitting “and especially in one or two of their number,”
until this larger thought is grasped; after which let the
sentence be read as a whole.</p>

<p>Following the usual plan, a class lesson is added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I was in Paris (which is in France), I saw a great many
pretty things.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Read this sentence carefully and you will find something we have
not had before: a group of words in parenthesis.</p>

<p>You notice, we should have very good sense without this group.
Read it: “When I was in Paris I saw a great many pretty things.”</p>

<p>So you see, the words “which is in France” are not so important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
as the rest of the sentence. You might say they were thrown
in after you had thought of the other idea.</p>

<p>Now, I want you to read the sentence aloud, leaving out the
group, “which is in France.” After you have done this five or six
times, then read the whole sentence, keeping in mind that the
words in parenthesis are not very important, but just thrown in to
let people know that you mean Paris in France, and not some other
Paris.</p>

<p>The groups that are thrown in are not always put in parenthesis.
But that does not make any difference in the reading. Here are a
few examples. I want you to practice on them just as you did on
the first example in this lesson.</p>

<p>1. “The king of England, who was a very brave man, won several
victories over the French.”</p>

<p>2. “The largest school in our city, which is Chicago, has more
than five hundred children in it.”</p>

<p>3. “During the Christmas vacation, which lasts ten days, I went
to see my grandmother.”</p>

<p>4. “Frank did all his mother asked him to do; but William,
because he was careless and disobedient, gave his mother and
teacher a great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>This last example makes very clear what we have been studying
in this lesson. You see plainly that the words, “because he was
careless and disobedient,” are put in simply to explain why
William gave a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>You must be very careful about this kind of sentence, because
there are a great many of them on every page, and you will be sure
to miss them if you are careless.</p></div>

<p>The teacher should ask the pupils to bring in other
examples, and have them read in the class. He should also
select examples from the reading book.</p>

<span class="fs60">VALUES</span></h3>


<p>This feature of expression is one of the most vital. It has
to do with the value of each phrase of the sentence and each
phase of the whole selection. With every change of thought
and emotion comes another form of expression, and these different
forms we may call Values. We apply the term Transition
to the act of passing from one shade of thought or feeling
to another. All transitions are not necessarily emotional,
and yet those most significant are certainly of this character.
Let us first consider a few examples not strongly marked with
emotion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“<em>Three quarters round your partners swing!</em>”</p>
<p class="verse0">“<em>Across the set!</em>” The rafters ring,</p>
<p class="verse0">The girls and boys have taken wing,</p>
<p class="verse2">And have brought their roses out!</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis “<em>Forward six!</em>” with rustic grace,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ah, rarer far than&mdash;“<em>Swing to place!</em>”</p>
<p class="verse0">Than golden clouds of old point lace,</p>
<p class="verse2">They bring the dance about.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the foregoing we have a picture of the country dance.
We hear the figures called out by the old fiddler, and see the
ever-varying changes of <em>The Money Musk</em>. Study the
lines so as to be able to bring out the calls clearly, noting
the two distinct calls at the opening, and the abrupt break in
the sixth line.</p>

<p>The next extract presents a wife confiding to a friend the
story of her courtship. Her husband is a true knight, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
would perhaps resent it to have even his bravery form the
subject of conversation. The story has reached its conclusion
when the speaker says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Our elder boy has got the clear</p>
<p class="verse0">Great brow; tho’ when his brother’s black</p>
<p class="verse0">Full eyes show scorn, it&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and she is probably about to add some such statement as, “It
behooves one to look out,” when suddenly the husband appears
on the scene. With a woman’s ready wit, she breaks off the
sentence abruptly, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">Gismond here?</p>
<p class="verse0">And have you brought my tercel back?</p>
<p class="verse0">I was just telling Adela</p>
<p class="verse0">How many birds it struck since May.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We might put into words what passes through her
mind. She is about to add something further concerning
the eyes of her boy, when she hears the sound of feet along
the walk. Expecting her husband, the concluding words of
her sentence pass from her mind as she turns to see the visitor.
It is Gismond. He must not know that she has been
speaking of him. The tercel in his hand gives her the opportunity
of opening the conversation, which she is quick to do,
adroitly pretending that it was of that very tercel she and her
friend had been conversing before his arrival.</p>

<p>One more illustration of this kind will suffice. A tender,
loving woman is talking to her husband. He is a learned
poet, and perhaps just a trifle of a pedant. He is most minute
and exact in all he does, ever losing sight of the spirit in
the letter. The wife is the true poet, caring nothing for the
archæology and philology and the geography, but quick to
perceive the inner meaning of the poetic. He has told her a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
story in the past, and she is going now to tell it back to him
with a new moral.</p>

<p>Here is the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">What a pretty tale you told me</p>
<p class="verse2">Once upon a time</p>
<p class="verse0">&mdash;Said you found me somewhere (scold me!)</p>
<p class="verse2">Was it prose or was it rhyme,</p>
<p class="verse0">Greek or Latin?</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the woman comes to “somewhere,” she finds she
has forgotten the source of the original story. That means so
much to him! It is so important! With a quizzical look,
she pretends to rack her brains for the missing information,
knowing all the time she will not find it, and knowing equally
well that it makes no difference in the story. Then, with a
coy expression and a look of mock humility on her face, she
lets fall her eyes, meekly acknowledging her awful guilt,
and stands prepared to accept her just punishment, saying,
Scold me! I deserve it. I have sinned; my punishment is just.</p>

<p>Many students find it no easy task to make these transitions
naturally. Some do not make them at all, but run the
two phases of thought or emotion together. Others anticipate
the coming idea, and hurry the last two or three words before
the break. The proper training is to <em>write or think out the
incomplete sentence</em>, then let it more or less quickly vanish
from the mind as the new conception grows clearer, without
betraying the fact that one is conscious of a coming interruption.
For instance, in the second example, one must read
up to and through “it” without the slightest suggestion of
the coming of Gismond, and even think the conclusion of the
sentence. Then hear or suddenly see Gismond just as the
word “it” falls from the lips, and dismissing from the mind
the former idea, conclude with the joyous, wifely welcome and
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>It might be proper to remark here that the same principle
applies to the reading of dialogue. Except in rare cases the
reader should not in any way anticipate the speech of one
character while rendering the words of another.</p>

<p>For those who do not intend to become readers, but who
would be preachers or lawyers, the practice here recommended
will prove of great value. Too many speakers, in their excitement
on the one hand and in their spiritlessness on the other,
glide along line after line in one monotonous drift. A study
of these exercises will teach the necessity of transitions, and
train in the control of the mental action in this regard,&mdash;a
control antecedent to that most important requisite, variety.
After almost every paragraph or stanza there is more or less of
change in the thought, and the apprehension of this change
will be sufficient to modulate the vocal expression.</p>

<p>Even where there is no abrupt change in the flow of ideas,
there is often a gradual transition from one emotion to
another, and these transitions may occur several times within
one paragraph. Take the following excerpt from Webster’s
reply to Hayne. It is one paragraph; but it is divided into
four smaller paragraphs, each of which is a marked “phase”
of the thinking. Practice in the analysis of selections to
determine these phases is the best and only rational training in
transitions. But its value does not stop here; for the student
not only makes transitions, but is led, through careful
analysis, to discern shades of meaning and emotion he might
otherwise overlook:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir, the gentleman inquires why he was made the object of a
reply. Why was he singled out? If an attack has been made on
the East he, he assures us, did not begin it; it was made by the
gentleman from Missouri.</p>

<p>Sir, I answered the gentleman’s speech because I happened to
hear it, and because I chose to answer that speech which, if
unanswered, I thought most likely to produce injurious impressions.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I did not stop to inquire who was the original drawer of the
bill. I found a responsible endorser before me, and it was my purpose
to hold him liable, and to bring him to his just responsibility
without delay.</p>

<p>But, sir, this interrogatory of the honorable member was only
introductory to another. He proceeds to ask whether I had turned
upon him in this debate from the consciousness that I should find
an overmatch if I ventured on a contest with his friend from
Missouri.</p></div>

<p>Transitions in emotion do not differ in principle from
those we have been considering. The student must pursue
the same method with these as with the others, expressing
the first emotion until he comes to the break, making
then an elliptical paraphrase, and then presenting the new
emotion. An excellent model is the following speech of King
Lear.</p>

<p>The aged monarch has, in a fit of rage, cast adrift his
youngest child, and his eldest has turned him from her home.
He turns in despair to his remaining daughter, assured that
he will here receive a filial welcome. To his surprise, she
refuses to meet him; says she is sick and travel-weary; and
his amazed feeling finds vent in an uncontrolled explosion of
passion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Lear.</span> Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Gloucester.</span> Well, my good lord, I have inform’d them so.</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Lear.</span> Inform’d them! Dost thou understand me, man?</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Gloucester.</span> Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Lear.</span> The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father</p>
<p class="verse0">Would with his daughter speak; commands her service:</p>
<p class="verse0">Are they inform’d of this?&mdash;My breath and blood!</p>
<p class="verse0">Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">No, but not yet: may be he is not well:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse16">
&mdash;<cite>King Lear</cite>, Act ii., Sc. 4.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and he then proceeds to find excuses for her action, and that
of her husband, the Duke of Cornwall. There is hardly a
more pathetic incident in a most pathetic play than this, in
which the old man, past his eightieth year, after holding undisputed
sway through his long reign, is at last compelled to
temporize. He is about to send a message to the Duke, the
character of which is easily judged from his previous language.
If that message is sent, Lear will be alone in the world. But
suddenly his fearful position flashes upon him. The threat
dies upon his lips, gradually blending into apology and
conciliation.</p>


<h4>EXAMPLES OF EMOTIONAL TRANSITIONS.</h4>

<p>Note how, after the words, “whom they loved,” the
atmosphere changes from that of joy to that of dread and scorn&mdash;scorn

<h4>STUDIES IN “PHASES.”</h4>

<p>This extract from Tennyson’s <cite>Charge of the Heavy Brigade</cite>
contains five distinct phases, or strata, ending respectively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with the words, “fight,” “close,” “then,” “thousands,” and
“Brigade.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The trumpet, the gallop, the charge, and the might of the fight!</p>
<p class="verse0">Thousands of horsemen had gather’d there on the height,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a wing push’d out to the left and a wing to the right,</p>
<p class="verse0">And who shall escape if they close? but he dash’d up alone</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ the great gray slope of men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sway’d his saber, and held his own</p>
<p class="verse0">Like an Englishman, there and then;</p>
<p class="verse0">All in a moment follow’d with force</p>
<p class="verse0">Three that were next in their fiery course,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wedged themselves in between horse and horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fought for their lives in the narrow gap they had made&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Four amid thousands! and up the hill, up the hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gallopt the gallant three hundred, the Heavy Brigade.</p>

<p class="verse14">As when a boar</p>

<p class="verse0">Fling many a javelin;&mdash;yet his noble heart</p>
<p class="verse0">Fears not, nor does he fly, although at last</p>
<p class="verse0">His courage cause his death; and oft he turns,</p>

<p class="verse0">And thus King Priam supplicating spake:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse0">Haply is fiercely pressed by those who dwell</p>
<p class="verse0">Around him, and has none to shield his age</p>
<p class="verse0">From war and its disasters. Yet his heart</p>
<p class="verse0">Rejoices when he hears that thou dost live,</p>
<p class="verse0">And every day he hopes that his dear son</p>
<p class="verse0">Will come again from Troy. My lot is hard,</p>
<p class="verse0">For I was father of the bravest sons</p>
<p class="verse0">In all wide Troy, and none are left me now.</p>
<p class="verse0">Fifty were with me when the men of Greece</p>
<p class="verse0">Arrived upon our coast; nineteen of these</p>
<p class="verse0">Owned the same mother, and the rest were born</p>
<p class="verse0">Within my palaces. Remorseless Mars</p>

<p class="verse0">Calling to mind thy father! happier he</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Than I; for I have borne what no man else</p>
<p class="verse0">That dwells on earth could bear,&mdash;have laid my lips</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the hand of him who slew my son.”</p>
<p class="verse0">He spake: Achilles sorrowfully thought</p>
<p class="verse0">Of his own father. By the hand he took</p>
<p class="verse0">The suppliant, and with gentle force removed</p>
<p class="verse0">The old man from him. Both in memory</p>
<p class="verse0">Of those they loved were weeping. The old king,</p>
<p class="verse0">With many tears, and rolling in the dust</p>
<p class="verse0">Before Achilles, mourned his gallant son.</p>
<p class="verse0">Achilles sorrowed for his father’s sake,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then bewailed Patroclus, and the sound</p>
<p class="verse0">Of lamentation filled the tent. At last</p>
<p class="verse0">Achilles, when he felt his heart relieved</p>
<p class="verse0">By tears, and that strong grief had spent its force,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sprang from his seat; then lifting by the hand</p>

<p>It is especially in the reading of description that the study
of values will prove most beneficial. There are very few readers
who can make description interesting, and their failure is
in most cases due to the monotony arising from their inability
to perceive and make palpable the different values. The
reply of Achilles to Priam becomes most interesting reading
when values are carefully observed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Great have thy sufferings been, unhappy king!</p>

&mdash;<cite>The Iliad.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The subject may be presented to the class somewhat in
the manner of the following lesson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Suppose you were very busy studying your reading lesson, and
you were just about to read aloud a sentence like this:</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">There’s a good time coming, boys,</p>
<p class="verse2">A good time coming!</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">But when you came to the second “good,” let us suppose somebody
knocks at the door and you say, “Come in.” What has happened in
your reading? You have broken off one thought suddenly and
another has come in its place. Let us see how such a sentence
would look:</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">There’s a good time coming, boys,</p>
<p class="verse2">A good&mdash;Come in.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, what is the difference between this sentence and those we
studied in our last lesson? It is this: In the former lesson the new
thought that was thrown in was really a part of the principal
thought; but in this the new thought has no connection with the
principal idea. In the previous lesson the group that was thrown
in was a kind of explanation; in this lesson, the first picture is
driven entirely out of mind by the second.</p>

<p>Breaks in the thought are of many kinds, and it is very necessary
that you should be on the look-out for them. Here is an example of
a kind you will find quite often:</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“Halt!” The dust-brown ranks stood fast.</p>
<p class="verse0">“Fire!” out blazed the rifle-blast.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The words “halt” and “fire” are commands given by the
general; the sentence that follows each of these words tells us
what happened after the commands were given.</p>

<p>Another kind of break is found in those selections in which
there are two or more persons speaking. As in this: “Frank said,
‘Will you go to school with me?’ and his brother said, ‘No, I don’t
like it.’ ‘Not like school?’ replied Frank, who was very much surprised,
‘I would rather go there than anywhere I know.’” You
can see plainly that there is a break when the reader changes from
one person to another.</p>

<p>The last kind of break we shall speak about in this lesson is that
which occurs between the stanzas of a poem or between the paragraphs
of a prose selection. I need not give any examples here, for
you will find them on every page of your reader. All I need do is
tell you that the new paragraph or the new stanza generally begins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with a new thought. So you must be sure to get that new thought,
and hold it well in mind, before you try to express it.</p>

<p>In closing this lesson I want to show you that you may learn how
to read such examples as we have had, if you will but be careful.
You must be sure to get each new picture before you utter a word.
Take the first example. You have read the first line, “There’s a
good time coming, boys,” and you are just about to repeat it. Now
think what you are going to say, and just as you come to the word
“good,” imagine you hear a knocking, and say, “Come in.” If
you will only think what the words mean and see the picture,
there will be no trouble about reading the example well.</p></div>

<p>A few examples for class use are appended. The teacher
may easily invent suitable contexts:</p>

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<span class="fs60">EMOTION</span></h3>


<p>Teaching children to read with feeling is one of the most
difficult tasks falling to the lot of the teacher, and yet it is one
that has, if successfully accomplished, far-reaching results.
For, apart from the legitimate development of emotion, it
enlarges their sympathy and lays the foundation for a genuine
love of literature.</p>

<p>We must confess that emotional expression is rarely found
in our public schools. It would avail little to discuss the
causes of this condition in detail. In this chapter we shall try
to discover a remedy. Emotion in reading comes largely
through the imagination. Unless the mind conceives the
thought, how can the nerves thrill and tingle? It is for this
that we need teachers who are themselves lovers of the beautiful,
sublime, tender, in order that they may impart their appreciation
and feeling to their classes. Emotion is catching,
and so is the absence of it! Time, time, time, is here the
great need. It takes time to think; time for the picture to
come forth in its fulness out of subconsciousness. Is not
imagination the basis of literary interpretation, of historical
study, yes, even of mathematics and science? The time spent
on the development of imagination and emotion in the
reading lesson will show its results in every other study.</p>

<p>If, then, the teacher would get the right emotion, he must
see to it that the child has the proper and adequate stimulus.
Appeal to his everyday experience and make that serve as an
introduction to the new experience of the poem.</p>

<p>Let us suppose we are speaking to the children:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If your class were to have a contest with another class, let us say
in spelling, and your class were to come out victorious, you would,
no doubt, feel very joyful over the result. Now, let us suppose that
after the victory one of the members of the class should get up on
his seat and wave his hand above his head, crying: “Three cheers
for our class!” Would there be any difference between the way in
which he spoke those words and the way in which he would read
the same words if they came in a sentence like this: “If we win I
shall give three cheers for our class”?</p>

<p>Of course, you will see at once that there would be a great deal
of difference. In the first place, he would be very joyful, and perhaps
excited, and this joy and excitement would get into his voice,
and he would call out, “Three cheers for our class,” with a great
deal of feeling, or emotion; and everybody would see at once just
how exultant he was. Now, what is it that causes that feeling, or
emotion? I do not think that there will be much difficulty in
answering this question. He was very much excited before the
spelling contest came off, and now that it has been decided in your
favor there is a feeling of great joy that comes over the whole body,
and it is almost impossible to keep back the expression of that joy.
In other words, he has been strongly moved.</p>

<p>I want to impress now upon you that as you go on with your
study of reading, you will find that there is a great deal of emotion
in many of the passages you will be called upon to read, and the only
way to discover what the emotion is, must be by getting a very clear
picture. But remember that the picture itself is not very likely to
move you unless you enter into the spirit of the picture just as
you entered into the spirit of the spelling contest. Do you see my
meaning? One might say the words, “Three cheers for our class,”
and not express very much emotion. One might even have a very
clear picture of the whole spelling match, and yet not be very much
moved. But if you will close your eyes and let the picture get hold
of you, I think there will be no trouble about the emotion. Let
me see whether I can make clear to you what I mean by letting the
picture get hold of you.</p>

<p>Suppose we take this line from a well-known speech, “Wolsey
on His Fall:”&mdash;“Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness!”
Who speaks those words? is the first question. The answer is: An
old man who has been for many years one of the leading men in the
court of Henry VIII. He has used every effort to gain great power,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and has forgotten his God, and now at last the king has cast him off.
Just after Wolsey has been informed of his loss of power, he utters
the words quoted above. Just think how much these words
mean to this poor man. Think how much he must suffer, and then
try to feel as much as you can what it would mean to you if everything
you had hoped for and struggled for were to be taken away
from you. Of course, I know that you have not been so ambitious
as Wolsey, but yet I think you will have no trouble in imagining
just how you would feel if everything you cared for were to be taken
away from you. Well, this is all that you need feel in order to read
with emotion the lines of Wolsey. Just think this over for a few
minutes, and then see how much regret you can feel as you utter
these words. Be sure that you get the meaning of the words;
be sure you get hold of the picture; try to imagine just how you
would feel if you were very deeply disappointed, and then utter the
words of Wolsey.</p>

<p>This, then, is what I mean by telling you to let the picture get
hold of you. When you were exultant over the result of the spelling
contest, joy possessed you. When Wolsey learned of his fall,
sorrow and remorse possessed him. So with all emotions. You must
think over the whole story; you must think over all the events
connected with it until you really feel somewhat as the speaker felt
whose words you are reading. Then there will be no trouble
about the expression.</p></div>

<p>The teacher will observe that the two illustrations are
chosen from two distinct fields: one near to the child’s
experience, the other far removed from it. It is further
observed that both are direct discourse rather than description.</p>

<p>It seems the best plan to begin the definite study of emotional
expression by using extracts in which the pupil uses
direct rather than indirect discourse. The reason for this is
that it is far more difficult to read, with expression, a passage
of description in which the pupil would be expected to put
emotion, than a piece of direct quotation. For instance, is it
not easier for a child to enter into the spirit of the first of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
following stanzas than into that of the second, granting even
that it is difficult to conceive the anguish of the father?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">The father came on deck. He gasped,</p>
<p class="verse2">“O God! thy will be done!”</p>
<p class="verse0">Then suddenly a rifle grasped,</p>
<p class="verse2">And aimed it at his son:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Jump&mdash;far-out, boy, into the wave!</p>
<p class="verse2">Jump, or I fire!” he said;</p>
<p class="verse0">“That only chance your life can save!</p>
<p class="verse2">Jump! jump! boy!” He obeyed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">He sank&mdash;he rose&mdash;he lived&mdash;he moved,</p>
<p class="verse2">And for the ship struck out:</p>
<p class="verse0">On board we hailed the lad beloved,</p>
<p class="verse2">With many a manly shout.</p>
<p class="verse0">His father drew, in silent joy,</p>
<p class="verse2">Those wet arms round his neck,</p>
<p class="verse0">And folded to his heart his boy&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse2">Then fainted on the deck.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the second place, the reason for choosing selections in
which the emotion is akin to those of the child’s own experience
must be clear. How many pupils ten or eleven years old
can be expected to enter into the spirit of Whittier’s <cite>The
Barefoot Boy</cite>?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Blessings on thee, little man&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!</p>
<p class="verse0">With thy turned-up pantaloons,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thy merry whistled tunes;</p>
<p class="verse0">With thy red lip, redder still,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kissed by strawberries on the hill;</p>
<p class="verse0">With the sunshine on thy face,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace;</p>
<p class="verse0">From my heart I give thee joy!</p>
<p class="verse0">I was once a barefoot boy!</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is only to discourage him, to ask him to feel like an adult
who looks back upon the joys of boyhood. One hears this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
selection read in an affected voice and manner, where it is clear
that the child is simply trying to imitate his teacher. But
such experiences simply go to prove the contention that children
should not be called upon to represent emotions far
removed from their own experience.</p>

<p>But how shall we get our pupils to express emotions
beyond their experience? The answer is: the teacher should
strive to find those experiences in the child’s life that are
similar to those of the selection to be read. We have shown
how this might be done in the line from Wolsey’s speech.
The child has experienced regret; let us make use of this
experience to get him to feel something of Wolsey’s feeling.
Again (and this applies largely to advanced classes), it is by
no means necessary that the pupil should ever have come into
contact with the picture that stirs the writer, in order to
represent the latter’s feelings. It is the joy that the lover
of nature feels that finds expression in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">How the robin feeds her young,</p>
<p class="verse0">How the oriole’s nest is hung;</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the whitest lilies blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the freshest berries grow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the ground-nut trails its vine;</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the wood-grape’s clusters shine;</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the black wasp’s cunning way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mason of his walls of clay.</p>

<p class="verse10">
&mdash;<cite>The Barefoot Boy.</cite> <span class="smcap">Whittier.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>But how can we get the true expression from one who
knows nothing of the joy we take in contemplating the pictures
of this stanza? By reminding him that our joy is not
far different from his when rejoicing in a beautiful book, a
lucky hit at baseball, or a pretty Christmas gift. Let us
remember that it is not enough that he shall get the pictures:
he must get the joy. And if he cannot get the joy from the
pictures of the poet, he must get it from the memory of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
own past joy, no matter under what circumstances. It is
simply a question of transferring his own past emotion to the
present moment.</p>

<p>Summarized, our points are:</p>

<p>First, choose emotions near to the child’s experience.</p>

<p>Second, transfer his past experiences and emotions to the
particular poem or stanza to be read.</p>

<p>Third, use direct discourse, in drill work, as far as possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would not be advisable to use selections in our
reading lessons that call for an extremely difficult exercise of
imagination on the part of the child, but since these selections
are found in our reading books it is well to know how
to do the best possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The most important point of all is that children must be
brought into contact with nature. We cannot expect them to
delight in a description of a sunset, or a robin’s nest, or a
bunch of pansies, when they have never delighted in sunsets,
or robins’ nests or pansies. When their early training is wise
they will not need to transfer their emotions from another
realm to read with true expression.</p>

<p>We are now to enter the more complex realm of expression,
in which the emotion is more intense, and instead of being
a single emotion is a blending of many. Take, for example, the
trial scene from <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>. There are many
speeches of Shylock that might illustrate our point, and we
shall take the first that presents itself. The Duke of Venice
has been urging Shylock to abandon his suit, whereupon the
latter replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I have possessed your grace of what I purpose;</p>
<p class="verse0">And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn,</p>
<p class="verse0">To have the due and forfeit of my bond.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">What emotions does Shylock portray? There is the emotion
of hatred of Antonio and the feeling of obstinacy; and there is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
further, the sense of wrong that has been heaped upon his race
in general, and himself in particular. It would be useless to
discuss how far each of these elements is an emotion. It is
sufficient for our purpose to have shown that these three
mental conditions are present virtually at one time in the brain
of the speaker. Now, if any one of these elements (to say
nothing of others that might be mentioned) is omitted, the
characterization will lack truthfulness.</p>

<p>There is another element in complexity of expression that
needs a moment’s attention. The emotion itself may be a
simple one, but the character we aim to represent may be so
far removed from our own that one must assume or take on
many attributes. For instance, if one were portraying old
Adam in <cite>As You Like It</cite>, he would be compelled to manifest
the weakness of old age in body and voice. Now, when
the old man says, “Dear master, I can go no further; O, I
die for food,” it is not sufficient for the reader to portray
simply the pathos of the line, but his expression becomes
more complex in so far as it must manifest both the pathos
and the weakness.</p>

<p>In preparing to present the emotions in the following
extracts it is well for the student to study carefully the nature
of the thought, the emotion, and the character separately, and
conceive each of the simpler emotional elements by itself.
If he is representing, let us say, pathos and dignity, let him
hold dignity before his mind until the whole being responds;
then let him conceive pathos by itself; and, finally, let him
conceive pathos <em>and</em> dignity, and endeavor to present them.
This process will not be necessary in all cases; for there
are those who can conceive these more complex conditions
with one effort, as it were. But unless the student has
this ability, the preceding process should be followed. And
even when a student has the necessary ability to conceive the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
complete expression at once, he is very likely to lose some of
what might be called the ingredients of a composite emotion.
For instance, in representing the strong language of one who
might be said never to lose his anger, the student who is particularly
choleric by nature is very likely to forget the dignity
of the character. He may be reminded of his error by recalling
dignity to his mind, and at once the natural temperament
of the speaker will be modified by the new stimulus.</p>

<p>It might also be well to consider here another reason for
the practice of these illustrations. Many students are temperamentally
restricted and shy, and others have become so
through training and environment. Before these can hope to
become effective readers there must be a certain amount of
genuine abandon. Hence, even if a student may never have
any use for the ability to impersonate, the practice here
recommended will prove to be one of the best, surest, and
quickest methods of bringing him out of himself. The abandon
thus gained will stand him in good stead in any effort he
may be called upon to make as a public speaker.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that niceties of form are not to be
expected for a long time. If the student’s abandon is
developed, that is all that should be expected.</p>

<p>In the following speech the student must never forget that
Othello is a warrior, one accustomed to command, and of large
heart. His dignity, therefore, must be manifest throughout
the address:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</p>
<p class="verse0">My very noble and approv’d good masters,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</p>
<p class="verse0">It is most true; true, I have married her;</p>

<p class="verse0">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</p>

<p class="verse0">More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</p>
<p class="verse0">And therefore little shall I grace my cause</p>
<p class="verse0">In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</p>
<p class="verse0">I will a round unvarnished tale deliver</p>

<p class="verse0">I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</p>

<p class="verse14">

</div></div>

<p>Another excellent extract for practice is the following
speech of Cassius from the first act of <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>. Note
the dignity, the sarcasm, the ridicule, the contempt, and the
sense of triumph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
<p class="verse0">Think of this life; but, for my single self,</p>
<p class="verse0">I had as lief not be, as live to be</p>
<p class="verse0">In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>
<p class="verse0">I was born as free as Caesar; so were you:</p>
<p class="verse0">We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
<p class="verse0">Endure the winter’s cold as well as he:</p>
<p class="verse0">For once upon a raw and gusty day,</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
<p class="verse0">Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
<p class="verse0">Leap in with me into this angry flood,</p>
<p class="verse0">And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</p>
<p class="verse0">Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in,</p>
<p class="verse0">And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</p>
<p class="verse0">The torrent roared, and we did buffet it</p>
<p class="verse0">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
<p class="verse0">And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</p>
<p class="verse0">But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>

<p>These speeches of Cassio in <cite>Othello</cite> show remorse, self-contempt,
with anger and regret:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cassio.</span> Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh! I have lost
my reputation. I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iago.</span> As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.
Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without
merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at
all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are
ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his
mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one
would beat his offenseless dog, to affright an imperious lion. Sue to
him again, and he’s yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassio.</span> I will rather sue to be despised, than to deceive so good
a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an
officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear,
and discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
spirit of wine! if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee
devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iago.</span> What was he that you followed with your sword? What
had he done to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassio.</span> I know not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iago.</span> Is’t possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassio.</span> I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an
enemy in their mouths, to steal away their brains! that we should,
with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into
beasts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassio.</span> It has pleased the devil drunkenness, to give place to

unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil.&mdash;<cite>Othello</cite>, Act ii., Sc. 3.</p></div>

<p>In conclusion, begin with simple emotions. Do not ask
the younger pupils to represent intense pathos, great
solemnity, and the like. Reserve these for the upper grades
of the high school. Again, avoid the baser emotions, such as
anger, hate, jealousy. Time does not permit us to enlarge on
this, but the whole trend of the best psychology is in favor of
this admonition. Select extracts in which the characters
manifest simple, noble, inspiring, and uplifting feeling.
Patriotism, self-sacrifice, love of nature, these are the themes
with which the imagination of the pupils should come into
contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The teacher is heartily advised to gather a dozen or more
extracts and speeches (from this book and elsewhere) under
three or four significant heads, such as patriotism, love of
nature, etc., and to keep the class at each phase until definite
results are attained. There is no hesitation in deprecating
the method that compels teachers to teach any lesson simply
because it follows, numerically, the preceding lesson. The
proper method is hinted at elsewhere. A few words are
now added to justify that method. In many readers there
may be two patriotic selections; one at the beginning, one at
the end. Probably a year will intervene between these two.
Is it not good pedagogy to take up these lessons in succession?
To keep the pupils in a patriotic mood for five consecutive
days must be certainly productive of better results than can be
obtained by the other method of Lesson I, Lesson II, Lesson
III. So also with other emotions. When a certain emotion
is present in only one or two paragraphs of a selection, only
those paragraphs need, of course, to be prepared.</p>

<span class="fs60">ATMOSPHERE</span></h3>


<p>This element of expression, perhaps more than any other,
manifests the artistic nature of the reader; artistic, inasmuch
as the atmosphere, or vocal color, shows the sensitiveness of
the reader to sense stimuli; shows that he is moved by the
contemplation of the beautiful, the sublime, the tender, the
pathetic. This element is called by different names, but perhaps
none is more significant than Atmosphere. This effect is
not easy to describe, and yet it is as real as rhythm or inflection
or any other of the elements discussed in this book. Atmosphere
is that sympathetic quality of voice that manifests the
spirit of literature. Who can fail to notice the tender
motherly sympathy that pervades every word of the lyric
<em>Sweet and Low</em>? Now compare this with the knights’
chorus from <cite>The Coming of Arthur</cite>. This is permeated
throughout with the spirit of the Round Table. The spirit
of motherly love in the former, and of knightly courage and
the clang of arms in the latter, completely envelop these
poems, and permeate every letter. Therefore, in the rendering
the reader must exercise the greatest care not to dissipate this
atmosphere. The least misstep, one false note, and the
atmosphere is dissipated.</p>

<p>In longer selections there may be variety of atmosphere in
the different stanzas or paragraphs, provided always that the
variety enhances the poem as a whole. Mere variety in reading
is not art, but chaos, says Professor Corson.</p>

<p>The following lines from Matthew Arnold’s <cite>Sohrab and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Rustum</cite><a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> illustrate the principle of variety in unity. The
poem purports to be an extract from the epic of Rustum, the
Persian Achilles, and is especially marked by a dignity truly
Homeric. This atmosphere of dignity envelops every line.
Hence pathos and joy, patriotism and defiance, scorn and contempt,
and all the other emotions, are always dignified. The
Tartar champion, Sohrab, challenges the bravest Persian
champion to meet him in single combat; and the Tartar
leader, Peran-Wisa, announces the challenge. The Tartars
love their hero, and the thrill that pervades their army is
significant of that love. But the Persian champion, Achilles-like,
sulks in his tent; and the knowledge of this fact, when
the announcement of the challenge is heard by the Persians,
fills them with awe and dismay. Read the following lines,
bringing out the significant atmosphere of the two parts of the
contrast, but being careful to bear in mind the general
atmosphere of dignity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">And the old Tartar came upon the sand</p>
<p class="verse0">Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse2">“Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars hear!</p>
<p class="verse0">Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.</p>
<p class="verse0">But choose a champion from the Persian lords</p>
<p class="verse0">To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.”</p>
<p class="verse2">As, in the country, on a morn in June,</p>
<p class="verse0">When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,</p>
<p class="verse0">A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,</p>
<p class="verse0">A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran</p>
<p class="verse0">Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.</p>
<p class="verse2">But as a troop of peddlers from Cabool,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The vast sky-neighboring mountain of milk snow;</p>
<p class="verse0">Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass</p>
<p class="verse0">Long flocks of traveling birds dead on the snow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves</p>
<p class="verse0">Slake their parch’d throats with sugar’d mulberries&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">In single file they move and stop their breath,</p>
<p class="verse0">For fear they should dislodge the o’erhanging snows&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The reader must also bear in mind that from the very
beginning of each picture the atmosphere of joy and fear
respectively must be in the mind, and must never be lost sight
of under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Sometimes the atmosphere is modified by the fact that the
speaker is quoting the words of another person, and then it is
often a matter of the most subtle analysis to determine the
extent to which the quoted words will modify the atmosphere
of the reader, whether speaking in his own person or in the
person of another.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of literature that must be considered
in this connection. First, that class in which the reader tells
the story in his own person. Second, when the reading is a
personation throughout. An example of the first class is
<cite><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'The Idyls of the King'">The Idylls of the King</ins></cite>; and of the second, the “Instigation”
speech of Cassius in <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>. The principle
governing atmosphere applies equally and in the same way to
both kinds of selections. The knowledge of this fact will
often be valuable to the reader.</p>

<p>We get a good example in the “Instigation” speech,
where Cassius tells Brutus that Caesar, when he had a fever,
cried, “‘Give me some drink, Titinius,’ as a sick girl.”
The whole matter of atmosphere, as far as quoted words are
concerned, will be made clear by a study of this simple
passage. Cassius is so exercised over the success of Caesar
and his own consequent humiliation, that his scorn and rage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
are well-nigh boundless. As the torrent of his emotion rushes
forth, is it not entirely inconsistent with our knowledge of
human nature to suppose that that torrent would be so
impeded or arrested when Cassius came to the above words,
that he would stop to reproduce the actual manner and tones
of Caesar? What Cassius probably does is to suggest something
of the effeminate manner of Caesar enveloped in Cassius’
own atmosphere of bitterest loathing and contempt. One
will be helped in work of this kind by asking himself the question,
What is the atmosphere of the speaker? Then, having
determined this, he must next make up his mind, through his
knowledge of human nature, to what extent this atmosphere
is modified by the quoted words that are introduced into the
body of the story. He may be assisted in determining this
by putting a second question to himself, Is what the quoted
words convey, or the manner in which they are conveyed, of
the greater importance? This is well illustrated in <cite>King
Robert of Sicily</cite>. It makes no difference in this particular
poem how the sexton uttered the words, “Who is there?” and,
consequently, it would be a mistake to give them any very
significant atmosphere. As a matter of fact, the words are
really equivalent to indirect discourse; the expression would
convey exactly the same meaning to the listener if read,
Asking who was within. The following from <cite>King Lear</cite> is
full of suggestiveness in this connection. We recall that
Kent has sent a gentleman to Cordelia to tell her of the condition
of her father. Later in the drama, Kent meets the
gentleman, and from him gets the story of the manner in
which Cordelia received the sad news of her father’s suffering.
How truly ridiculous it would be for the gentleman to imitate
the manner of Cordelia! The psychological explanation of
what happens is probably this: As he relates the story to
Kent, the tearful face and voice of Cordelia come into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
mind, and, since there is always in human nature a tendency
to become that which one describes, something of the manner
of Cordelia will be suggested in the voice of the speaker; but
let us bear in mind that the imitation is not intentional
and detailed, but instinctive and suggestive only. It is not
meant that the reader is not conscious of what he is doing,
but that the gentleman (to use a concrete illustration) is not
consciously imitating Cordelia. The artistic reader in
reproducing this scene is conscious of what he is doing, but
consciously sympathetic, not imitative:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Kent.</span> Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Gentleman.</span> Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;</p>
<p class="verse0">And now and then an ample tear trilled down</p>
<p class="verse0">Her delicate cheek: it seemed, she was a queen</p>
<p class="verse0">Over her passion, who, most rebel like,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sought to be king o’er her.</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Kent.</span> <span class="pad8">O, then it moved her.</span></p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Gentleman.</span> Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove</p>

<p class="verse0">That played on her ripe lip, seemed not to know</p>
<p class="verse0">What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence</p>
<p class="verse0">As pearls from diamonds dropped.&mdash;In brief,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>This leads to another feature of the study of atmosphere.
In the following lines from the <cite>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</cite>,
we certainly speak slowly; but let it be remembered
that this is done, not in imitation of the slow movement of
the objects described, but in sympathy with them. The
solemnity and dignity of the occasion so affect us that our
movement becomes slow, and this movement and the right
vocal quality give us the proper atmosphere.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</p>
<p class="verse2">The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea,</p>
<p class="verse0">The plowman homeward plods his weary way,</p>
<p class="verse2">And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</p>
<p class="verse2">And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</p>
<p class="verse0">Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</p>
<p class="verse2">And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,</p>
<p class="verse2">The moping owl does to the moon complain</p>
<p class="verse0">Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,</p>
<p class="verse2">Molest her ancient solitary reign.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree’s shade,</p>
<p class="verse2">Where heaves the turf in many a moldering heap,</p>
<p class="verse0">Each in his narrow cell forever laid,</p>
<p class="verse2">The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let us remember, too, that an event which once filled us
with joy may be recalled with pain and sorrow, and that it is
our present condition that determines the atmosphere. Browning’s
<cite>Patriot</cite> will illustrate this.</p>

<p>The untrained reader is altogether too prone to imitation;
but let him bear in mind that imitation, if ever art, is its
lowest form. The province of the reader is to manifest,
through his interpretation, the innermost spirit of the poem.
Very often by imitating, by literally reproducing the voice, manner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and movements, we obscure the underlying spirit of the
line, paragraph or poem. There are certain readers, for
instance, who sing, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me</i>, in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aux Italiens</i>.
For the sake of argument, we might admit, that at the end of
the poem there might be some slightest justification for this
procedure; but in the beginning, it is absolutely indefensible.
The speaker is in a deep reverie; he dwells in the past. His
mind goes back to a visit to the opera-house in Paris, years
before. The opera is <cite>Il Trovatore</cite>; and the heroine comes
before us seeking her lover, who has been snatched from her
arms through the jealousy of another. She arrives before the
monastery as the monks chant the <em>Miserere</em>. Her prayer
ascends heavenward; and when she ceases, there rises clear
and passionately the voice of her lover from within his cell,
singing, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me</i> (Forget me not). As the audience
in the opera-house hear these words, their minds go back
to the past. The king goes back to his early triumphs; the
queen’s mind reverts to her life in Spain; the wife of the
Marquis of Carabas lets her thoughts glide back to her first
husband; and to the speaker’s mind there comes the vision of
his early love. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me</i>, then, is the source of
the poem. The tie that binds us to the past is the poet’s
theme, “Old things are best.” Now let us look at the stanza
at the end of which occurs the line we are discussing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The moon on the tower slept soft as snow,</p>
<p class="verse0">And who was not thrilled in the strangest way,</p>
<p class="verse0">As we heard him sing while the gas burned low,</p>
<p class="verse0">“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me</i>.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">In the first place, when one sings these lines, he is just a little
likely to be deemed presumptuous when it is recalled that
the previous stanza has said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">And Mario can soothe with a tenor note,</p>
<p class="verse0">The souls in purgatory.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is hardly likely that the reader is a Mario; but this is a
small criticism, comparatively speaking. The atmosphere of
the poem is one of reverie; and what possesses the speaker is
not the literal way the words were sung, but the memory of
the thrill that passed through him and through the audience
as these words rang out in a pause of the solemn <em>Miserere</em> of
the monks. Let it be borne in mind that the argument is
not against the singing as singing, but against the method
that would completely destroy the atmosphere of the poem
for the sake of a vocal affectation. What should be expressed
is the rapture of the speaker as he recalls those passionate
words and tones, in his present moment of contemplation.
There are certain reprints of this poem that leave out the
stanzas describing the effect of the song on the king, the queen,
and the marchioness. Does this not prove that those who
print such versions have missed the very essence of the story?</p>

<p>There is one more element that we are to discuss in this
connection, and that is the atmosphere of sympathy that
envelops the reading of description. This atmosphere shows
the effect upon us of that which the author describes.</p>

<p>The tendency of most readers is toward imitation,&mdash;to
groan and moan, and laugh and cry, whenever these words
appear in the selection interpreted. In such passages as the
following from Aldrich’s <cite>Face Against the Pane</cite>, we have
heard more than one reader imitate the screeching and the
moaning, and the groaning and the breaking:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">She hears the sea bird screech,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the breakers on the beach</p>
<p class="verse0">Making moan, making moan.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And again, in the same poem, we have heard imitations of the
tolling bells in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">How it tolls for the souls</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the sailors on the sea;</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">In these passages and all similar ones, as, for instance, those
already quoted from the <cite>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</cite>,
our aim should be to manifest through the atmosphere
the effect of the description upon ourselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will assist us to get a clearer conception of this
important feature if we discuss a few typical examples, even
repeating some of the selections already used in the discussion.</p>

<p><em>Example 1</em> (from <cite>Sohrab and Rustum</cite>). The atmosphere
of the first simile is that of joy; not in imitation of the joy of
the Tartars, but because we are moved to joy by our sympathy
with Sohrab.</p>

<p><em>Example 2</em> (<em>ibid.</em>). We do not express the fear of the
Persians or of the peddlers, but our contempt for the former&mdash;perhaps
slightly tinged, through sympathy, with their fear.</p>

<p><em>Example 3</em> (from <cite>King Robert of Sicily</cite>). The atmosphere
is that of simple narrative, which is in no wise changed
by the words of the sexton.</p>

<p><em>Example 4.</em> Eugene Field’s <cite>Little Boy Blue</cite> presents a
father standing before the dust-covered toys of his dead child.
The father speaks throughout, and yet there are those who
actually imitate the voice and manner of the child in the
opening lines of the second stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“Now don’t you go till I come,” he said,</p>
<p class="verse2">“And don’t you make any noise;”</p>
<p class="verse0">So toddling off to his trundle-bed</p>
<p class="verse2">He dreamt of the pretty toys.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is the father we want, not the child.</p>

<p><em>Example 5</em> (from the <cite>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</cite>).
We read the passage slowly, not because we desire to imitate
the slow movement of the objects described, but because we
are impressed by their solemnity.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the principle here discussed has no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
value except for advanced pupils or for those who desire to
make a specialty of reading. This is a grave error and one
that has had much to do with the spiritless reading of our
schools. At least one-half of the selections in our readers,
above the second, present opportunities for the expression of
what we have termed sympathy. In the chapter on
Values we observed that there were ever-varying phases of
thought and feeling, each one of which would be read with a
different atmosphere. Let us look at another complete poem
solely with a view to applying the principles of phases and of
atmosphere:</p>

sympathy with the picture.</p>

<p>l. 7, 8.&mdash;Simple description.</p>

<p>l. 9-12.&mdash;Simple description.</p>

<p>l. 13-16.&mdash;The important part this pathway is to play in
the poem and the danger of the rider will bring the suggestion
of fear into the voice of the reader. It is the effect of
the picture upon us that we must manifest; this is half the

largely that of sympathy&mdash;fury and dogged, gloomy determination.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Perhaps there might be something of our horror and

<p>l. 50-56.&mdash;Virtually the same atmosphere, throughout, of
terror, strife, determination, hate.</p>

<p>l. 59-64.&mdash;See l. 50-56.</p>

<p>l. 65-68.&mdash;Terror and fear increase until the climax on
“fall.”</p>

<p>l. 69, 70.&mdash;Terror and pity.</p>

<p>l. 71.&mdash;Observe the transition. Restrained pathos to the
end.</p>

<p>The most important fact to be borne in mind in endeavoring
to develop the pupil’s sympathy with what he describes is
this: imitation of sounds, and of gestures, and of movement,
is a very low order of art. We can not imitate thunder, but we
can show in our voices the awe that it inspires. When we
unconsciously hurry our reading under the impulse the imagination
receives from contemplating, let us say, the rapid
movement of a cavalry charge, we do so not in imitation of,
but in sympathy with, the picture. This is not primarily a
question of art, but of nature. It is only ignorant teaching
that says to a pupil, “Is that the way the thunder roars?” or
“Read more rapidly; don’t you see that you are describing
the flight of the horses?” Furthermore, if we read slowly a
passage describing a funeral procession, there is no conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
imitation of slowness, but a sympathy with the solemnity,
stateliness and dignity of the occasion.</p>

<p>A very little observation will show us whether the imitation
is conscious or sympathetic. In the former case, the voice
will be expressing <em>merely</em> speed or slowness. In the latter,
there will be speed or slowness, too, but accompanied by an
indefinable and yet recognizable <em>quality</em> of voice, which is the
expression of our sympathy. This is an infallible criterion.</p>

<p>Lastly, it must be urged that we give more time to this
work. The imagination cannot be developed in a week or a
month; and unless there is imagination, there can be no
sympathy. It is difficult to restrain one’s self and not dwell
longer on the value of the training of the imagination. We have
no hesitation in saying that that feature of education is the
most neglected. Such training as is here suggested will, in
many cases, do much to bring about a more favorable condition
of affairs. But it takes time, and plenty of it. The
teacher should read to the class quite often such passages as
are likely to stimulate the imagination. Make the class follow
attentively and get them to give back the picture, as far as
possible, in minutest detail. Do this again and again and
improvement must follow. Just in proportion as the imagination
is stimulated may we hope for a better class of reading.
<em>We have no time to teach any subject poorly!</em></p>

<p>This phase of the subject may be presented to pupils in
some such manner as this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let me tell you a story:</p>

<p>The other day, a little child came to its mother, saying, “Oh,
mother! I just saw a beautiful toy in the window: I wish you would
buy it for me.” <em>The sweet voice was full of pleading.</em> The mother
was very poor, and had hardly earned enough to pay for fuel.
<em>How could she spare even the few pennies for the toy?</em> But she said
to herself, “This is Christmas time;” and the tears came into her
eyes. The little one saw the tears, and said: “What are you crying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
for, mother?” <em>And then the mother hugged her child to her breast
and kissed her again and again, saying over and over</em>, “Because I
love you! Because I love you!”</p>

<p>When Christmas morning dawned the little toy was on the mantel
and the child was happy. But when the time for breakfast
came, the child asked her mother why she did not eat; and the
mother answered, “I am not hungry, darling; don’t mind me,” and
she smiled tenderly upon the sweet face, upturned to kiss her.</p>

<p>After you have read this simple tale two or three times, I think
you will begin to feel some sympathy with the loving mother who
would do without her food to give joy to her little child. When
you read the sentences I have put in italics, if you have really tried
to see the pictures, I am sure you will feel some sympathy that will
make your reading so different from the reading of, let us say, the
first sentence in this lesson. Take the line, “The sweet voice was
full of pleading.” Can’t you imagine some sweet child-voice pleading
for the toy? Well, then, listen to that voice, and after you
have, then read, “The sweet voice was full of pleading.” You will
find that your voice will be so full of sympathy that it will say not
only the words, but also will express love, and tenderness, and sympathy.
You will think, perhaps, some such thought as, “She was
such a lovely child and she wanted the toy so much. It made me
feel sorry to hear her ask for it.” There is another sentence in
italics that I want you to think about. When you read, “And the
tears came into her eyes,” can you not feel something of the sadness
of that mother, as she thinks how much she would like to buy the
toy, and yet there is nothing to buy it with? When you express
your feeling, your voice will say, “And the mother’s heart was sad
when she thought that her darling could have no little gift at
Christmas, when it seemed everyone should be made happy. How
disappointed the sweet one would be when she found out how
many toys her playmates had while she had not one!” All these
thoughts will run through your mind if you will only think about
this scene long enough, and then your voice will express that sympathy
with the picture you are describing without which you can
never be a good reader. Let us then close this lesson by reminding
you that the best way to develop our feelings as we read is through
sympathy.</p>

<p>There are several other phrases and sentences in this story that I
want you to study sympathetically for to-morrow’s lesson. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
after you have grasped the idea of this lesson, be sure, in every
selection you read hereafter, that you do not fail to pay particular
attention to sympathy.</p></div>

<p>Let us, in closing this long but most vital discussion,
direct attention in a few words to the psychology of the
atmosphere of description. When we are giving the description
for its own sake, desiring simply to impress the picture
upon the audience, we should probably use the normal quality.
To illustrate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">A fellow in a market-town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Most musical, cried “Razors!” up and down,</p>
<p class="verse2">And offered twelve for eighteen pence;</p>
<p class="verse0">Which certainly seemed wondrous cheap,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for the money quite a heap,</p>
<p class="verse2">As every man would buy, with cash and sense.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">When, however, we are somewhat moved through the contemplation
of what we see, when it takes possession of us, we
should be likely to manifest our feeling in a suggestive imitation
of the object described. See the <a href="#PASO">third stanza</a> of <cite>The
Fight of Paso del Mar</cite>. The third stage is reached when the
picture moves us to such an extent that imitation and suggestion
disappear, and we show merely our own feelings.
See lines 69 and 70 of the same poem. In reading these we
do not utter the cry, nor do we show the death anguish, but
our own feelings of pity and perhaps terror. There is a
fourth stage, in which the conditions of the second and third
are blended. Again we may use the same poem as an illustration.
In lines 53 and 54, one could conceive a reader
partaking through sympathy of the passion of Bernal, and
yet manifesting his own feeling of fear and horror at the same
time.</p>

<p>It is believed that this classification is psychologically
sound, and that it will repay close study. It need hardly be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
added that the attention of the pupil is not to be drawn to
the details. Selections for practice follow:</p>

<p class="verse2">And pluck’d the ripen’d ears,</p>

<p class="verse0">O we fell out I know not why,</p>
<p class="verse2">And kiss’d again with tears.</p>
<p class="verse0">And blessings on the falling out</p>
<p class="verse2">That all the more endears,</p>
<p class="verse0">When we fall out with those we love</p>
<p class="verse2">And kiss again with tears.</p>

<p class="verse0">Rent the tough plates, but fail’d to reach the skin,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Rustum pluck’d it back with angry groan.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum’s helm,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest</p>
<p class="verse0">He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,</p>
<p class="verse0">Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;</p>
<p class="verse0">And Rustum bow’d his head; but then the gloom</p>
<p class="verse0">Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,</p>
<p class="verse0">And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who stood at hand, utter’d a dreadful cry;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">No horse’s cry was that, most like the roar</p>
<p class="verse0">Of some pain’d desert lion, who all day</p>
<p class="verse0">Hath trail’d the hunter’s javelin in his side,</p>
<p class="verse0">And comes at night to die upon the sand.</p>

<span class="fs60">CONTRASTS</span></h3>


<p>It is because contrasts are a distinct feature of literature
that it is well to make the study of them and their vocal presentation
a feature of the reading course. It is understood,
of course, that the teacher must use his discretion as to the
time when the definite study of contrasts should be undertaken;
but when clearly presented and discriminatingly illustrated,
even young children can be led to perceive the artistic
value of contrast, to enjoy it as art, and to manifest their
appreciation of it in their reading. It should not be difficult
to show young children that Cinderella’s character is made to
appear more lovable because it is set over against those of her
sisters. Children enjoy such effects as well as adults, when
pleasantly and suggestively presented to them.</p>

<p>In literature there are found illustrations of contrast upon
every page. There are contrasts of ideas, contrasts of emotions,
contrasts of scenes, contrasts of characters, and many
others. Under the head of “The Central Idea” will be found
numerous examples of the first class. We shall here consider
a few illustrations of the other classes, while in later pages will
be found illustrations for more extended study.</p>

<p>Contrast of emotion is admirably illustrated in the following
scene from <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act iii., Sc. 1:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
found my daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Why there, there, there, there! a diamond gone, cost
me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
our nation till now; I never felt it till now:&mdash;two thousand ducats
in that; and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear! would she were
hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them?
Why so;&mdash;and I know not what’s spent in the search: why, thou
loss upon loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to find
the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge: nor no ill luck stirring
but what lights on my shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing;
no tears but of my shedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard
in Genoa,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> I thank God, I thank God! Is it true, is it true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news!
ha, ha!&mdash;Where? in Genoa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night
fourscore ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Thou stick’st a dagger in me; I shall never see my
gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company
to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> I am very glad of it: I’ll plague him; I’ll torture
him: I am glad of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not
have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> But Antonio is certainly undone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me
an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of
him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make what
merchandise I will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.</p></div>

<p>We cannot fail to remark how the contrast between Shylock’s
emotions (when bemoaning the loss of his ducats at one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
moment, and cursing the daughter who has robbed him and
eloped with a Christian at another) serves to bring out his
peculiar character.</p>

<p>Contrast of character is brought out in every great play.
Horatio and Hamlet, Cordelia and her sisters, Macbeth and
his wife, suggest themselves as examples. The third act of
<cite>King Lear</cite>, where the jester’s jibes are interpolated between
the fearful outbursts of the king, is a striking example of
character, as well as of emotional contrast.</p>

<p>It may be well to remark that the two parts of a contrast
do not always occur in succession. Do not the last three or
four speeches of Shylock depend, for their effect, upon the keeping
in mind by the audience of his emotions and bearing during
the former scenes? Let the audience forget these, and they have
lost a most significant æsthetic detail. Similarly, when King
Robert utters the speech beginning, “Thou knowest best,”
the whole effect is lost unless we bear in mind that never for
three years has his answer to the angel’s question been other
than, “I am, I am the king.”</p>

<p>The following examples will afford good practice:</p>

<p>Sheltered by the verdant shores, an hundred triremes were riding

citron groves of Syrasella. My early life ran quiet as the brooks by
which I sported; and when at noon I gathered the sheep beneath
the shade, and played upon the shepherd’s flute, there was a friend
to join me in the pastime.... One evening, my grandsire, an old
man, was telling of Marathon and Leuctra, and how, in ancient
times, a little band of Spartans, in a defile of the mountains, had
withstood a whole army. I did not then know what war was; but
my cheeks burned, and I clasped the knees of that venerable man,
until my mother, parting the hair from off my forehead, kissed my
throbbing temples and bade me go to rest, and think no more of
those old tales and savage wars. That very night the Romans
landed on our coast. I saw the breast that had nourished me

<p>The selection entitled the “Choric Song,” a part of
Tennyson’s <cite>The Lotos-Eaters</cite>, is a fine study in contrast.
The speakers are the followers of Ulysses, who are debating
whether they shall remain in this new found land of the Lotos
or return to their homes. The first, third, fifth, and seventh
stanzas are in striking contrast to the others. The feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the sailors as they alternately contemplate their life as it is
and has been, in contrast with what it might be should they
remain here, are strikingly depicted.</p>

<p>The subject of contrasts may be presented to the class in
some such manner as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have you not noticed how much brighter the sunlight seems to
be after a thunder-shower? how keenly we enjoy a victory after
defeat seems certain? Why is this? Because the clouds by their
blackness make us appreciate the sunlight; and the fear of losing
the contest makes us doubly glad when we win. If we had sunshine
all the time, how monotonous it would be, and how little we
should notice it! And you must see that if the other side in a contest
were very weak, we should not derive much pleasure from the
outcome. All nature is full of these contrasts: joy and sorrow,
light and darkness, success and failure, are always around us. So
literature, which deals with nature, contains these contrasts, too.</p>

<p>In literature, the contrast is used to impress upon us some idea
or picture more completely than could be done by merely describing
it. This is done by placing before us the idea and its opposite: it is
like placing a dark screen behind a white marble statue. This
being so, we can easily see how necessary it is for us to recognize
these contrasts in order that we may present them with our voices
to the listeners.</p>

<p>Let us take a few simple examples. Our grandparents tell us
that it took them sixty days to cross the ocean from England to
America; and now, we know, it takes but six. The best way to
show how great an advance this century has made in boat-building
would be by contrasting the past and the present. We might say:
“It took my grandparents sixty days, in a sailing vessel, to cross the
ocean, but now we go by steam in six.”</p>

<p>Again: “Last week I was sleighing and skating in Minneapolis;
but to-day I am plucking violets and japonicas in the gardens of
Savannah.”</p>

<p>In both examples you observe that the concluding idea of the
sentence is made more striking because of the contrast it makes
with the first part. Be sure to bear this in mind. A contrast is
made up of two ideas, and you must have both of them in mind or
your reading will be a failure. Do you not see that this is true? If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
you were to say “I am plucking violets in Savannah to-day,” there
would be very little emotion shown in your voice: you would be
making just an ordinary statement. But if you were thinking of
the great change you had made; how strange it was that you
should be in the midst of winter one week and in the midst of spring
the next, then the contrast would be such a pleasant one that your
voice would be full of joy, and your joy would be largely the result
of the contrast. If you had violets all the year round, perhaps you
would hardly notice them.</p>

<p>Here are two more examples of contrast, more difficult to
express, but more beautiful than the others.</p>

<p>Imagine a noble warrior whose whole life is devoted to good
deeds. Imagine him as he speaks the following words descriptive
of the old time tournament. Then imagine how grateful he would
feel for the relief after the fierce struggle, a relief so beautifully
described by the author:</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">My good blade carves the casques of men,</p>
<p class="verse2">My tough lance thrusteth sure,</p>
<p class="verse0">My strength is as the strength of ten,</p>
<p class="verse2">Because my heart is pure.</p>
<p class="verse0">The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,</p>
<p class="verse2">The hard brands shiver on the steel,</p>
<p class="verse0">The splintered spear-shafts crack and fly,</p>
<p class="verse2">The horse and rider reel.</p>
<p class="verse0">They reel, they roll, in clanging lists,</p>
<p class="verse2">And when the tide of combat stands,</p>

<p class="verse2">That lightly rain from ladies’ hands.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this next example, we have the picture of a king who is punished
for his pride by being deprived of all his power, wealth, and
friends. See how powerful the contrast he makes as he, who should
be master, rides in mock state amid the splendor of his courtiers.
The word “he” in the first line does not refer to the king, but to
another.</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Then he departed with them o’er the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the lovely land of Italy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose loveliness was more resplendent made</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">By the mere passing of that cavalcade,</p>
<p class="verse0">With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir</p>
<p class="verse0">Of jeweled bridle and of golden spur.</p>
<p class="verse0">And lo! among the menials, in mock state,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,</p>
<p class="verse0">His cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind,</p>
<p class="verse0">The solemn ape demurely perched behind,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Let us remember that contrasts are of two kinds: logical
and emotional. The former are largely antitheses, such as
“I said John, not Charles,” and will need but casual attention.
The pupils will perceive them without difficulty. The
other class need much care. Perhaps the most important fact
that the teacher must bear in mind concerning these, is that
their successful rendition depends upon the pupils’ keeping
both parts of the contrasts in mind, <em>the first serving as a
background, or relief, for the second</em>. Just as contrasts in
literature afford variety and relief, so the reading aloud of
contrasts gives great variety in vocal expression.</p>

<span class="fs60">CLIMAXES</span></h3>


<p>In Genung’s <cite>Practical Rhetoric</cite> we find the following
definition of Climax: “This figure, which depends upon the
law that a thought must have <em>progress</em>, is the ordering of
thought and expression so that there shall be uniform and evident
increase in significance, or interest, or intensity.”</p>

<p>An excellent illustration of increase in Significance is
found in the following speech from Regulus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The artisan had forsaken his shop, the judge his tribunal, the
priest the sanctuary, and even the stern stoic had come forth from
his retirement.</p></div>

<p>Here the author desires to show that the return of Regulus
had thrown all Carthage into a state of intense excitement.
The artisan, who could ill afford to lose his day’s labor, had
left his shop to join the throng that was taking its way to the
great square of the city. The judge, whose duty it was to
administer justice, could not refrain from joining the crowd.
The priest, whose sacred office was to tend the altars of the
gods, he too, for once, was neglecting his duty. And even
the stern stoic, whose philosophy taught him to remain
unmoved under any and all conditions of life, even he, perforce,
must mix with the multitude thronging the Carthaginian
streets. Each succeeding clause presents to us a
more unusual disturbance of the normal condition of
Carthaginian affairs; and the climax is reached when even the
man whose whole philosophy teaches him never to be moved,
is impelled to do violence to his life-long convictions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following lines from Lord Chatham’s speech we
have an illustration of the climax of Intensity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign
troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms!
Never! Never! Never!</p></div>

<p>The verbal expression does not progress; and yet the emotion
increasing in force, as the mind dwells upon the thought,
finds vent in increasing intensity of vocal expression. It may
be well to note that by increasing the intensity is not necessarily
meant greater loudness or higher pitch; but greater
intensity of feeling, which may result in greater loudness or
higher pitch, or, on the other hand, in deeper, more controlled,
or more dignified expression.</p>

<p>We have thus far been considering simple and palpable
forms of climaxes. Let us turn now to the examination of
the more difficult and complex. The following speech is
uttered by Marullus, one of the tribunes, in the first scene of
the first act of <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>. We recall the fact that Marullus
appears to be greatly surprised that the citizens of Rome
should dress themselves in holiday garb and make holiday to
celebrate the return of the victorious Caesar. He inquires of
them what is their purpose in thus celebrating; and, after
considerable bantering, one of the crowd remarks that they
make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph,
whereupon Marullus speaks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</p>
<p class="verse0">What tributaries follow him to Rome,</p>
<p class="verse0">To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?</p>
<p class="verse0">You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</p>
<p class="verse0">O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</p>
<p class="verse0">Have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,</p>
<p class="verse0">To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</p>
<p class="verse0">The livelong day, with patient expectation,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</p>
<p class="verse0">And when you saw his chariot but appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Have you not made an universal shout,</p>
<p class="verse0">That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</p>
<p class="verse0">To hear the replication of your sounds</p>
<p class="verse0">Made in her concave shores?</p>
<p class="verse0">And do you now put on your best attire?</p>
<p class="verse0">And do you now cull out a holiday?</p>
<p class="verse0">And do you now strew flowers in his way,</p>
<p class="verse0">That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?</p>
<p class="verse0">Be gone!</p>
<p class="verse0">Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</p>
<p class="verse0">That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The first three ideas are arranged in order of climax. It may
be termed a climax of Significance. But we must not lose
sight of the fact that, throughout the speech, as the emotion
of Marullus increases, we shall have a climax in Intensity.
In line 4, we have another climax, reaching its height on the
word “worse.” Then, with “many a time and oft,” begins
another climax, which, with occasional diminutions, continues
to “shores.” In the next four lines we have a climax which
is intensified by contrast. The word “now” is full of reproof
and condemnation; and by the time the speaker utters the
words “over Pompey’s blood” he is so overcome with the
enormity of the crime that, with the utmost fervor, he urges
the mob to run to their houses and pray to the gods to refrain
from visiting upon their heads the rightful punishment of
their ingratitude.</p>

<p>This cursory analysis of the speech has shown us that while
there is a steady increase in intensity from the first word to
the last, there are, besides, many smaller climaxes in Significance.
We find these in lines 1 to 3, line 4, lines 6 to 16,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
lines 17 to 20, lines 22 to 24. It may be said in passing, that
the climax in lines 17 to 20 forms a very interesting study.
“Best attire,” “holiday,” “strew flowers in his way,” are
plainly arranged in order of climax, while the three “now’s”
are evidently an anti-climax. The first “now” is most significant,
while the last is of very little importance. On the
other hand, the fact of strewing flowers in Caesar’s way is
clearly a very much more striking mark of their ingratitude
than that of merely putting on their best attire.</p>

<p>Just as in the long paragraph that we have analyzed we
find a climax, so in a drama or in a poem we find this steady
progression. That scene which is the climax of the action is
gradually led up to by successive steps, each one more significant
and intense than the preceding. The artist is careful not
to destroy his effect by anti-climax, for to do so would be to
lessen the interest of the audience, and consequently defeat
the very purpose of the drama or story. The play of <cite>The
Merchant of Venice</cite> illustrates this. Each scene manifestly
increases the intensity which finally culminates in the trial
scene, after which the play, being a comedy, descends to a
restful close at the end of the fifth act.</p>

<p>In recitation the ordinary climax of Significance presents
no great difficulty for the reader. As soon as he appreciates
the fact of the growth in significance, he will manifest that
increase in greater loudness or intensity, or increase of passion.
It may be well to repeat that the increase need not be in loudness,
nor is it necessary that the pitch of the voice be raised;
but there will unquestionably be some form of climax in
the expression. The difficulty begins when the climax is
made up of smaller climaxes, as in the example from <cite>Julius
Caesar</cite>, or when a climax is, so to speak, one of considerable
length. In the latter case, the utmost care must be used to
husband one’s resources, that when the moment of intensest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
feeling is reached, there shall be sufficient power to produce
the required result. One of the most striking defects in
oratory, recitation, and acting, is the inability to present
climaxes artistically. Either from a failure to perceive their
literary value, or from lack of control, or other limitations of
technique, the effect is often spoiled, with most disastrous
results. The student, then, is advised to determine carefully
that point of a passage or story where the strongest effect is to
be made, and then to be careful to subordinate all else to this.</p>


<h4>GRADATION</h4>

<p>This feature of literary art may appropriately be considered
in connection with Climax. The law of gradation demands
that the progress from the smaller to the greater be gradual
and regular. In the musical and elocutionary arts this is by
no means an easy task, and great care must be taken to reserve
the strongest effects for the culmination of the climax. This
is not difficult when the climax is short, but in the longer
examples one requires all the art at his command.</p>

<p>To assist in rendering a climax artistically, let the reader
bear in mind the end from the beginning. Then the temptation
to overdo the less important details will be reduced.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Speaker, we have a right to tax America.” Oh,
inestimable right! Oh, wonderful, transcendent right! the assertion
of which has cost this country thirteen provinces, six islands,
one hundred thousand lives, and seventy millions of money.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This last example is a peculiar one. Under ordinary circumstances
thirteen provinces would be more valuable than six
islands, and surely one hundred thousand lives are more valuable
than seventy millions of money. On the other hand, the
figures in the last three phrases certainly rise to a climax.
On the whole, I think it better to regard this as an oratorical
climax, understanding Burke not to have had in mind anything
more than to present the losses of England, as each
occurred to him, while his emotion and indignation rise with
each enumeration.</p>

<p>The climax is a very important feature in reading. It
stimulates the imagination and feelings, and, through them,
the voice. It should be remembered that no definite method
of expressing a climax vocally can be laid down. In one case
the pitch may rise; in another it may fall. Sometimes the
force increases; at other times it diminishes. Hence, the
admonition so often given must be repeated: Do not tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the pupil to raise his voice, or to speak louder. Work at his
imagination. If there be a climax there, it will come out in
his expression.</p>

<p>Frequent drills in climax will do much to give flexibility,
power, and range to the voice. And that, too, in a far more
rational way than through any mechanical exercises in pitch
and force.</p>

<p>The following plan of presenting climaxes to classes has
been found extremely helpful:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Read the following sentence carefully to yourself. Notice each
clause, and try to discover if there is not something here that we
have not had before. I want to ask you not to read more than that
sentence until you have studied over it for some time. “It is an
outrage to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is an atrocious
crime; to put him to death is almost parricide; but to crucify him&mdash;what
shall I call it?”</p>

<p>We have here another method used by writers and speakers for
making an idea more striking. In this case, the speaker is condemning
one who has caused the crucifixion of a Roman. The
orator desires to impress upon the judges the seriousness of the
offense. How does he do it? Instead of speaking at once about the
crucifying of the victim, he begins by showing that a far less serious
punishment was a grave offense against the Roman law. He says,
“It is an outrage to bind a Roman citizen.” Then he goes another
step, saying: “To scourge him is an atrocious crime.” Worse still:
“To put him to death” (by any means) “is almost parricide.” And
now, having shown that less extreme methods of punishment were
great crimes, the orator is ready for his final statement: “But to
crucify him&mdash;what shall I call it?” In other words, the speaker
seems to have exhausted his vocabulary in giving names to lower
crimes; when he comes to a name with which to describe the crime
of crucifying a Roman, he finds his vocabulary does not have one
strong enough. Do you not see how powerful an effect such an
arrangement of clauses must have? It is much stronger than if the
speaker had said merely, “I know no word to describe the crime of
crucifying a Roman citizen.”</p>

<p>Analyze the following sentence, and explain how the thought is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
made more striking by this kind of arrangement. “I know it, I
concede it, I confess it, I proclaim it.”</p>

<p>This method of increasing the effect is called climax. Whenever,
for any reason, a speaker or writer keeps on adding thought
to thought, making each succeeding idea stronger than the preceding,
we have a climax. Although you may never have called it by
this name you have used it many times. If you were determined to
do a certain thing you might say, “I can do it, I will do it, I must
do it.” Well, that is a climax. Or you might say, “You can’t have
it for ten dollars, for fifty dollars, for a hundred dollars.” That is
another climax.</p>

<p>Note this example: “If I were an American, as I am an Englishman,
while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never
would lay down my arms! never! never! never!” This, too, is a
climax, each of the last three “never’s” being stronger than the
preceding. If you will put yourself in the position of the speaker,
you will soon feel that each “never” after the first is the result of
stronger, more intense feeling. If you will think of it in this way
you will notice the effect in your expression.</p>

<p>We shall close this lesson with two illustrations. Your teacher
will tell you the story from which these extracts are taken, and then
you will prepare them very carefully, taking particular pains to
note the climax in each.</p></div>

<h3><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<span class="fs60">CONCLUDING REMARKS ON METHOD</span></h3>


<p>In taking leave of the pedagogy of the subject it may be
profitable to review some of the principal features of the
method advocated, and add a few hints on minor topics not
treated elsewhere.</p>

<p>The method herein laid down aims to present one principle
at a time; calls for specific preparation on the part of the
pupils; urges that there be definite grading of the difficulties
encountered by children in learning to read; advises strongly
against calling their attention to the vocal technique of
expression; and lastly, holds out the hope that the impression
will eventually find an outlet in true expression.</p>

<p>As at present taught, no distinction is drawn, in reading,
between the easy and the difficult, the simple and the complex.
We trust that in the suggestions of this book will be found at
any rate a partial solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>It should be impressed upon pupils from the outset
that they are studying the thoughts and feelings of others
that find expression in words upon the printed page. They
must discover the thoughts behind the words and then
express them; that is all there is to reading.</p>

<p>While it is believed that the order of the steps as here outlined
is a rational one, it is not claimed that this order is hard
and fixed. In advanced classes, where the method has not
been used in the lower grades, the teacher should endeavor to
discover the particular weakness of his pupils, and use with
them the step most likely to produce the desired effect. Or
if it is thought advisable, he may start with the first step and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
cover all the ground in one grade as fast as the pupils can
absorb the spirit of each step. But it must never be forgotten
that carelessness in reading is a habit not easily eradicated;
and, further, that because a pupil satisfactorily prepares a
lesson in, let us say, grouping, he will not necessarily have
formed the habit of grouping correctly. We are dealing with
complicated psychical phenomena, and until the eye, the
memory, the voice, in fact, all the elements of expression are
thoroughly co-ordinated, we are in constant danger of error.</p>

<p>The time deemed necessary in public schools to complete
all the steps, is about two years, beginning with the grade
third or fourth below the highest. Before the pupils reach
that grade, the sole effort of the teacher should be directed to
making the reading vital and meaningful. If this is done the
work of subsequent teachers will be relatively easy.</p>

<p>Avoid, and the admonition is repeated once more, talking
to the pupils about inflection, pause, and the like. These
are instinctive manifestations of mental states, and will
appear when the conditions are right.</p>

<p>Let the teacher not follow slavishly the order of lessons in
the regular reading book. Let him choose such selections or
parts of them as offer the best opportunity for practice where
the class most needs it. Let him further find extracts from
outside sources for class use. These may be written on the
board or mimeographed.</p>

<p>It has been said that we must have a technique if we would
read. This may be granted; but it is equally to be granted
that the principal technique is mental, and, moreover, that,
in the public schools, our aim is to produce simple, natural,
expressive readers, not artistic actors and orators. There is,
then, no necessity for drills on inflection, time, modulation,
and the like, as such. Give the pupil all the drill that is
necessary on the states of mind producing these effects, but let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
us never separate the technique from the mental condition
that will find instinctive expression in that technique.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Expression grows through expressing. If we will bear this in
mind, and present the right thoughts and emotions to be
expressed, at the right time, there should and will be no
difficulty.</p>

<p>It is suggested that, perhaps once a week, short extracts be
committed and recited before the class. There need be no
gesture, just simple saying. Such a procedure will give the
pupil confidence, develop his earnestness, improve his voice,
and in every way affect for good the reading spirit of the
class. Where a suitable selection can be found, it will be well
to give a stanza to each pupil. A word may be added about
the recitations that form so large a part of the closing exercises
in our schools. If the recitation were an honest, legitimate
presentation of the reading as taught in the school, there
could be no objection to it; but in most cases it is anything
but this. Special teachers are called in to “coach” the students,
and the result is far from satisfactory. A few lessons can seldom
make a reader, and where that plan partially succeeds, so
much greater is the hypocrisy; for the reading stands for the
work of the school rather than for that of an individual
teacher. A true showing of the work of the school, and one
that would in time be heartily appreciated by parents, would be
to select the good readers (a few hints to them are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that would be necessary), and let them, book in hand, read as
they would in class. If the class reading has been good, so
will be the individual reading; otherwise it has no business
to parade under false colors at public exercises.</p>

<p>To what extent shall pupils imitate? No fixed rule should
be laid down, but one might say that they should never
attempt to imitate inflections, pauses, rate of movement, and
the like. On the contrary, there seems to be much value in
stimulating the pupils’ imagination by having the teacher
read certain emotional passages for them. They then may
catch the spirit of the selection without any conscious effort
at imitation. There are many who train a class to read in
concert from imitation. The results of such training are
worse than baneful, leading only to inane, affected expression.</p>

<span class="fs60">LITERARY INTERPRETATION</span></h3>


<p>In the concluding part of this work it is purposed to lay
before the teacher some examples of literary interpretation.
The object of these is to assist him to a deeper insight into
literature, and hence to become a better reader and teacher
of reading.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that we accept as good reading
what is often the reverse simply because the subject matter
does not appeal to us or is only partly appreciated. A pupil
may read such a passage as the following in a commonplace
way, and be complimented by one teacher for his distinct
articulation and forceful utterance, whereas a teacher who
appreciated the true spirit of the lines would severely condemn
the reading.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;</p>
<p class="verse2">The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea;</p>
<p class="verse0">The plowman homeward plods his weary way,</p>
<p class="verse2">And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The explanation of the difference in the attitudes of the
teachers is that the former has no appreciation of the spirit
of the lines, while the latter keenly feels their tenderness, their
beauty, and their pensive solemnity.</p>

<p>The best way to learn to love good literature is to study
only good literature, and to study it again, again and again.
What is truly great art cannot be apprehended at a glance,
but requires time for its fullest appreciation. We believe,
however, that it is good pedagogy, in a work of this kind, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
lay before the teacher certain examples of what careful
analysis may reveal. The effect of such analysis upon the
reading must be evident to all.</p>

<p>We have already discerned that all analysis preparatory to
reading aloud is virtually literary analysis. This is well
illustrated in the chapters on Climax and on Contrast. It
remains, therefore, to deal only with certain broader aspects
of literary appreciation, in connection with which we shall
endeavor to show the application of the principles discussed
in Parts I and II to vocal interpretation.</p>


<h4>STUDY IN RHYTHM</h4>

<p>It is a truism to state that every poem should be a unity,
but we often forget a most important corollary, that every
line should be scanned with a view to determine that unity.
It is only in so far as we understand the parts that we understand
the whole. Let us illustrate this principle in the following
well-known poem:</p>


<p class="p2 pfs90">HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT

<p class="verse0">“Speed!” echoed the wall to us galloping through;</p>
<p class="verse0">Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And into the midnight we galloped abreast.</p>

<p class="verse0">At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Then I cast loose my buff coat, each holster let fall,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">And all I remember is, friends flocking round</p>
<p class="verse0">As I sat with his head ’twixt my knees on the ground,</p>
<p class="verse0">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,</p>
<p class="verse0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)</p>
<p class="verse0">Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The central idea in this poem is Roland; not the rider, not
the historical element. As a matter of fact, the poem has no
historical basis. Browning tells us somewhere that after a
tiresome and tedious sea voyage he longed for a gallop over
the English downs, and that this poem is a result of that
longing. The rhythm of the poem is peculiarly adapted to
express the bounding joy of the poet, and is in striking contrast
to the long, monotonous roll of ocean waves.</p>

<p>On studying the poem, we note the absence of any but
cursory reference to the rider, and, on the contrary, the
constant reference to the real hero, Roland. One might
imagine a setting for the lines something as follows: Around
a camp-fire are gathered many veterans of the wars. They
are telling of the gallant deeds of their war steeds, when one
of their number starts up and says:</p>

<p>“You talk of your horses; have you ever heard of mine?
Have you heard how my Roland helped to save Aix? No?
Let me tell you. You remember so-and-so’s famous campaign,
and how the enemy were preparing to take Aix.
You know, too, that the officer in command had no hope of
saving the city and was preparing to capitulate the moment
the enemy began the attack. Well, one night, just after we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had turned in, a messenger came in hot haste to tell us
that the king himself had that day started to relieve the city
and that we must carry the good news to Aix and thus
encourage them to hold out until his arrival. Our commander
called for three volunteers to undertake the dangerous
task of hearing the news. We&mdash;Joris, Dirck, and I&mdash;offered
our services. They were accepted, and a moment
after we had received our instructions,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">‘I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;’”</p>
</div></div>

<p>From now on observe how the poet fixes our attention on
Roland.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">With resolute shoulders, each butting away</p>
<p class="verse0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The whole of the fifth stanza is devoted to praise of
Roland; while the failure of the horses of Joris and Dirck
serves but to enhance the glory of Roland’s feat.</p>

<p>As soon as we perceive the meaning of the poem&mdash;its central
thought&mdash;the entire reading becomes permeated with the joy
and exultation of the rider in his steed. The poem is well
adapted to develop vocal flexibility, and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Tennyson’s <cite>Charge of the Light Brigade</cite> affords another
opportunity for analysis.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of this poem is that of a dirge. This does
not mean that we snivel and whine while rendering it, but that
the whole poem is enveloped in the atmosphere of dignified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
solemnity. It is true that this is not the popular view, which
seems to be that Tennyson wrote the poem to afford the reader
an opportunity of making descriptive gestures. Tennyson’s
heart ached for those brave fellows in their useless sacrifice; and
he wrote the poem, not primarily to show how they fought, but
that they fought in vain. True, there is a vein of stirring
patriotism in the lines, but all that is inferior in importance to
the dignified solemnity and controlled pathos of the speaker.</p>

<p class="verse2">Noble Six Hundred!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to overlook the constant recurrence of the
phrases “valley of Death;” “jaws of Death;” “mouth of
Hell,” and their significance. The keynote of the poem is
found in the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Some one had blunder’d:</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Here is the central thought. The men made a gallant
charge, went boldly and willingly to their doom; but it was
all a mistake, a fearful, horrible mistake. We care not for
the <em>fact</em> that cannons were to the right, to the left, and to
the front of them. The mere position is nothing. But who
can repress the shudder of despair as he contemplates that
heroic band surrounded by fires from death-dealing cannon?</p>

<p>On pages <a href="#Page_200">200 and 201</a> will be found three poems from
Tennyson, each of which presents a different aspect. The
first is marked by an exquisite simplicity. It contains but
one simple idea, which is set forth in the simplest language.
Consequently, the reading should be equally unassuming.
The least appearance of affectation or effort will dissipate the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The second is a lullaby. The rocking cradle is felt in
every line, while in the last line of each stanza we have the
rhythmic picture of the gradual cessation of the rocking, and
it seems impossible to omit the long pause before the last
word in each of these lines, a pause exactly equal to the time
of one of the preceding feet.</p>

<p>The third poem is of an entirely different nature. Here
we have the strength of spirit that animated King Arthur’s
Knights of the Round Table. When we bear in mind that
this song is sung after King Arthur’s claim to the throne,
which has long been in doubt, has been firmly established,
and he has taken Guinevere to wife, we can better understand
its passionate joy.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features in connection with
the study of literature is rhythm. The meaning of rhythm is
not always clearly apprehended, many regarding it simply as
poets’ playfulness, interesting in the nursery rhyme, tickling
the childish ear, but beyond that a useless and even senseless
filigree. Nothing could be farther from truth. Rhythm is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
not a conventional appendage of poetry, but its very heart,
life, spirit. It springs spontaneously from the poet’s heart,
and is the manifestation of his deepest feeling. Who can fail
to catch the bounding spirit of life and joy in the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I come, I come! ye have called me long;</p>
<p class="verse0">I come o’er the mountains with light and song;</p>
<p class="verse0">Ye may trace my step o’er the wakening earth,</p>
<p class="verse0">By the winds which tell of the violet’s birth,</p>
<p class="verse0">By the primrose stars in the shadowy grass,</p>
<p class="verse0">By the green leaves opening as I pass.</p>

<p class="verse14">

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee</p>
<p class="verse0">Jest, and joyful Jollity,</p>
<p class="verse0">Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nods, and becks, and wreathèd smiles,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such as hang on Hebe’s cheek,</p>
<p class="verse0">And love to live in dimple sleek;</p>
<p class="verse0">Sport that wrinkled Care derides,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Laughter holding both his sides.</p>
<p class="verse0">Come and trip it as you go</p>
<p class="verse0">On the light fantastic toe;</p>
<p class="verse0">And in thy right hand lead with thee</p>
<p class="verse0">The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty:</p>
<p class="verse0">And, if I give thee honor due,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mirth, admit me to thy crew,</p>
<p class="verse0">To live with her, and live with thee,</p>

</div></div>

<p>What a dignity is imparted to the scene by the rhythm in
the following extracts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Here are old trees, tall oaks and gnarlèd pines,</p>
<p class="verse0">That stream with gray-green mosses; here the ground</p>
<p class="verse0">Was never trenched by spade, and flowers spring up</p>
<p class="verse0">Unsown, and die ungathered. It is sweet</p>
<p class="verse0">To linger here, among the flitting birds</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And leaping squirrels, wandering brooks, and winds</p>
<p class="verse0">That shake the leaves, and scatter as they pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">A fragrance from the cedars, thickly set</p>
<p class="verse0">With pale blue berries. In these peaceful shades&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Peaceful, unpruned, immeasurably old&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">My thoughts go up the long dim path of years,</p>
<p class="verse0">Back to the earliest days of liberty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;</p>
<p class="verse0">And some through wavering lights and shadows broke</p>
<p class="verse0">Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.</p>
<p class="verse0">They saw the gleaming river seaward flow</p>
<p class="verse0">From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops,</p>
<p class="verse0">Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,</p>

<p>Often in the same poem the emotional changes are manifested
in changes of rhythm. Observe this in the following
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse4">Look! look! that livid flash!</p>
<p class="verse2">And instantly follows the rattling thunder</p>
<p class="verse2">As if some cloud-crag, split asunder,</p>
<p class="verse4">Fell, splintering with a ruinous crash,</p>
<p class="verse2">On the earth, which crouches in silence under;</p>
<p class="verse4">And now a solid gray wall of rain</p>
<p class="verse0">Shuts off the landscape, mile by mile;</p>
<p class="verse2">For a breath’s space I see the blue wood again,</p>
<p class="verse0">And, ere the next heart-beat, the wind-hurled pile,</p>
<p class="verse4">That seemed but now a league aloof,</p>
<p class="verse4">Bursts rattling over the sun-parched roof;</p>
<p class="verse2">Against the windows the storm comes dashing,</p>
<p class="verse2">Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing,</p>
<p class="verse8">The blue lightning flashes,</p>

<p class="verse6">And in one baffled roar,</p>
<p class="verse4">Like the toothless sea mumbling</p>
<p class="verse6">A rock-bristling shore,</p>
<p class="verse4">The thunder is rumbling</p>

<p class="verse6">Will silence return never more?</p>

<p class="noindent">Or in the concluding stanzas of Wordsworth’s ode on <cite>Intimations
of Immortality</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!</p>
<p class="verse6">And let the young lambs bound</p>

<p class="verse0">We in thought will join your throng,</p>

<p class="verse6">We will grieve not, rather find</p>
<p class="verse6">Strength in what remains behind,</p>

<p class="verse6">Which having been, must ever be;</p>
<p class="verse6">In the soothing thoughts that spring</p>
<p class="verse6">Out of human suffering;</p>
<p class="verse6">In the faith that looks through death,</p>

<p class="verse0">I only have relinquished one delight,</p>
<p class="verse0">To live beneath your more habitual sway.</p>
<p class="verse0">I love the brooks which down their channels fret,</p>
<p class="verse0">Even more than when I tripped lightly as they:</p>

<p class="verse0">Another race hath been, and other palms are won.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thanks to the human heart by which we live;</p>
<p class="verse0">Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears,</p>
<p class="verse0">To me the meanest flower that blows can give</p>
<p class="verse0">Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In blank verse we get the best and clearest illustration of
the meaning of rhythm. Here the poet has the utmost freedom,
untrammeled by rhyme or any limitations as to the
length of his stanza. The rhythm in the description of the
overthrow of Satan is most suggestive of strength and
determination:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">Him the Almighty power</p>
<p class="verse0">Hurl’d headlong flaming from th’ ethereal sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">With hideous ruin and combustion, down</p>
<p class="verse0">To bottomless perdition; there to dwell</p>
<p class="verse0">In adamantine chains and penal fire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who durst defy th’ Omnipotent to arms!</p>

<p class="verse10">
&mdash;<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, Book I. <span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>How clearly the frantic passion of Lear is shown in the
irregular, erratic, almost chaotic, rhythm of the following
speech:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!</p>
<p class="verse0">You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout</p>
<p class="verse0">Till you have drench’d our steeples, drowned the cocks!</p>
<p class="verse0">You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,</p>
<p class="verse0">Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,</p>
<p class="verse0">Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">Smite flat the thick rotundity o’ the world!</p>
<p class="verse0">Crack Nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once,</p>
<p class="verse0">That make ingrateful man!</p>

&mdash;<cite>King Lear</cite>, Act iii., Sc. 2.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Note how the varying rhythm in the following passage
corresponds with the ever varying moods of the King and
the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2">To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!</p>
<p class="verse0">Authority forgets a dying king,</p>
<p class="verse0">Laid widow’d of the power in his eye</p>
<p class="verse0">That bow’d the will. I see thee what thou art</p>
<p class="verse0">For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,</p>
<p class="verse0">In whom should meet the offices of all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;</p>
<p class="verse0">Either from lust of gold, or like a girl</p>
<p class="verse0">Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:</p>
<p class="verse0">But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,</p>
<p class="verse0">I will arise and slay thee with my hands.”</p>
<p class="verse2">Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,</p>
<p class="verse0">And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged</p>
<p class="verse0">Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch’d the sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">And strongly wheel’d and threw it. The great brand</p>
<p class="verse0">Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon,</p>
<p class="verse0">And flashing round and round, and whirl’d in an arch,</p>
<p class="verse0">Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seen where the moving isles of winter shock</p>
<p class="verse0">By night, with noises of the northern sea.</p>
<p class="verse0">So flash’d and fell the brand Excalibur:</p>
<p class="verse0">But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm</p>
<p class="verse0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>
<p class="verse0">And caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him</p>
<p class="verse0">Three times, and drew him under in the mere.</p>
<p class="verse0">And lightly went the other to the King.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs70 lsp">A BALLAD OF THE FLEET</p>

<p class="p1 pfs60">TENNYSON</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90">I</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And a pinnace, like a flutter’d bird, came flying from far away:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!”</p>

<h4><a id="RHY"></a>NOTES ON RHYTHM</h4>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza I</p>

<p>l. 1-2.&mdash;Normal rhythm.</p>

<p>l. 3.&mdash;Note the emphasis imparted to the call by the
trochees.</p>

<p>l. 4-6.&mdash;The effect of the internal rhymes <cite>Howard&mdash;coward</cite>,
<em>here&mdash;gear</em>, <em>sick&mdash;quick</em>, is very marked. Similar effects are
frequently introduced in the poem.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza II</p>

<p>l. 10.&mdash;The two emphatic syllables, <em>I’ve</em> and <em>nine-</em>, coming
in succession, add force to Sir Richard’s statement.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza III</p>

<p>l. 13.&mdash;Note how the author retards his movement and
hence impresses us with the slow moving picture, by drawing
his emphatic syllables together, as <em>So Lord How-</em>; <em>five ships</em>;
and <em>that day</em>. This effect is one of the commonest in
literature, and one of the most natural. This line will scan
as a normal line; but let us bear in mind that sense accent
determines the rhythm in English, not quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 16.&mdash;A strange device, the effect of which is to cause
Sir Richard’s gallantry to stand out most strikingly. In
spite of the fact that fifty-three Spanish galleons were coming
down upon him, the brave captain was as considerate in the
handling of his sick sailors as a mother of her babe. And
this is emphasized by making this statement in a line by itself.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza IV</p>

<p>l. 24.&mdash;Again note the strength imparted by the successive
accents in <em>huge sea-castles heaving</em>.</p>

<p>l. 25-27.&mdash;The abruptness aptly fits in with the sentiment.
Observe that the effect of the short line is brought out by
the rhyme, <em>fly&mdash;die</em>. The further apart the rhyme, the less
striking it becomes. See lines 43-45, and 57-59.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza V</p>

<p>l. 32.&mdash;Full of strength and admirably expressive in rhythm.</p>

<p>l. 36.&mdash;Again we observe the retardation and its effect.
Observe further, that this is the first time the concluding line
of a stanza has deviated from the normal, and note how appropriate
is the deviation; not merely for the sake of variety, but
the spontaneous expression of feeling.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza VI</p>

<p>l. 37-38.&mdash;How forceful is the effect of beginning each
line with the accented syllable!</p>

<p>l. 42.&mdash;The contrast of this line with the preceding is
most marked. Line 41 is long drawn out, while in 42 one
can feel the shock of the abrupt stop.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza VIII</p>

<p>l. 53-54.&mdash;The first four lines of this stanza are quite
regular, but when we reach the last two, observe the correspondence
between the rhythm and the sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza IX</p>

<p>l. 56-60.&mdash;How admirably the rhythm lends itself to the
expression of the feelings of the narrator as he recalls the
terrible strain of that never-ending night! One must read
the passage aloud to appreciate this effect.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza X</p>

<p>l. 63.&mdash;Observe the strength of <em>Fight on! Fight on!</em> and
also the contrast between the rhythm of this stanza and that
of Stanza IX.</p>

<p>The stanza as a whole moves quite rapidly, owing to the
preponderance of unaccented syllables. The appropriateness
of this rapid movement is recognized when we bear in mind
that the stanza is intended to cite but one incident of that
awful night, and serves only as a link between Stanzas IX
and XI.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XI</p>

<p>l. 70.&mdash;Compare this rhythm with that of line 56, and
observe how the emotion of Stanza IX is recalled by the
similarity of rhythm.</p>

<p>l. 83-90.&mdash;Compare with lines 25-28 and 91-95.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XIII</p>

<p>l. 100.&mdash;Compare with lines 42 and 103, and note
similarity of mood.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XIV</p>

<p>l. 112-119.&mdash;It is almost impossible to analyze the effect
of these lines, so admirably do sound, sense, and rhythm
correspond. We can, however, clearly observe the forceful
effect of <em>great gale blew</em>; the accumulation of power and size
in line 115; the exultant joy of the speaker as he describes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the effect of the storm in lines 116 and 117; and the gradual
diminution of the passion as the poem comes back to normal
movement in the concluding line.</p>


<h4>INTERPRETATIVE NOTES</h4>

<p>The poem as a whole is a magnificent specimen of vigorous
Anglo-Saxon. There are few inversions, the style is simple
and direct, and the imagery peculiarly appropriate. The
speaker is a survivor, and brings us face to face with one of
the proudest moments in the history of English naval
warfare.</p>

<p>The poem deals with an event at the close of the expedition
of the Spanish Armada against Great Britain, and it is
interesting to know that it is almost literally true to fact and
history.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza I</p>

<p>l. 4-7.&mdash;The opening words seem a little like brag. But
Sir Richard’s reply, which is borne out by history, proves the
contrary. The oath is not the vain oath of a braggart, but
the solemn words of one who believes in God and calls upon
Him to bear witness to the truth of his statement.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza II</p>

<p>l. 8.&mdash;The delivery of the first five words will certainly
manifest the pride of the narrator in such a leader.</p>

<p>l. 12.&mdash;Note the contempt expressed in <em>dogs</em> and <em>devildoms</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza III</p>

<p>l. 15-18.&mdash;Be sure to bring out the speaker’s emotion.
How the common sailor worships him who stayed to certain
death to save the lives of his sick men!</p>

<p>l. 21.&mdash;Note the irony, contempt, and even hate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza IV</p>

<p>l. 25-28.&mdash;The rhythm clearly indicates the abrupt manner
in which these lines should be read.</p>

<p>l. 29.&mdash;<em>We be all good English men</em>: this is Sir Richard’s
answer to their appeal.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza V</p>

<p>l. 33.&mdash;<em>Heart</em>: right into the midst of the fleet. The
Spaniards came down in double line of battle. It was evidently
Sir Richard’s intention to attempt to escape with his
fleet craft by running the gauntlet of heavy, large, unwieldy
Spanish galleons. A picture of these galleons, with their
triple and quadruple decks, will greatly assist us to comprehend
the disastrous outcome of one of the most elaborate
naval demonstrations in the history of the world. The vessels
were so unwieldy that only a few at a time could attack
the Revenge, and, by constant maneuvering, Sir Richard
could almost always avoid the effect of their cannonading.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza VI</p>

<p>l. 37-38.&mdash;There is bitter sarcasm in these lines as the
speaker recalls the outcome of the fight.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza VIII</p>

<p>l. 50.&mdash;<em>Bethought herself</em>: note the sarcasm.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza IX</p>

<p>l. 56-60.&mdash;The emotion of these five lines is very striking.
Oh! the anguish, horror, and suspense of that awful
night. The sun went down, but the battle went on. The
stars came out, but still no rest. And so on, on, on, through
that dreadful night.</p>

<p>l. 62-61.&mdash;Observe the sudden transition and the exultant
shout at the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza X</p>

<p>See <a href="#RHY">note on rhythm</a>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XI</p>

<p>l. 72.&mdash;Observe the note of pride and grim determination.</p>

<p>l. 74.&mdash;The speaker apologizes for even an appearance of
boastfulness.</p>

<p>l. 75-81.&mdash;Pathos.</p>

<p>l. 83-90.&mdash;Note the contrast between the emotion of Sir
Richard in these lines and that of the speaker in uttering
lines 75-81.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XII</p>

<p>l. 92-95.&mdash;The sailors would naturally speak rapidly. The
rhythm helps us to understand their feelings.</p>

<p>l. 93.&mdash;And therefore we have no right to kill ourselves.
A most significant line.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XIII</p>

<p>l. 99.&mdash;Observe the tribute the Englishman pays to his
foe. See also line 108. The voice should manifest the
speaker’s attitude and will when we grasp the situation.</p>

<p>l. 101-103.&mdash;Note and bring out the blunt defiance of Sir
Richard.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XIV</p>

<p>l. 111.&mdash;How natural seems the use of <em>her</em>! It is expressive
of the sailor’s love for his vessel. And further, we
remark that the Revenge becomes human as she yearns for
those who so long have seemed her very children.</p>

<p>l. 112.&mdash;Here we have one of the most significant lines in
the whole poem. History tells us that a storm arose and
shattered the remnant of the Armada, and sunk the battered
hulk of the little Revenge. Poetry conjures up this storm as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
an avenging Nemesis. Out of the lands <em>they had ruined</em>
comes the storm that avenges the Revenge.</p>

<p>l. 118.&mdash;What tenderness is there in that word <em>little</em>!</p>

<p>l. 118-119.&mdash;There is no regret in these lines. On the
contrary, they are full of exultation. Remember, the poet
was limited by history. He could not save the Revenge, but
he could sink her on the spot where the glorious victory had
been won. The picture of shattered greatness is not an
inspiring one. If the Revenge had not sunk, she would have
been dragged ignominiously at the hawser’s end into some
Spanish port, to become the object of every Spaniard’s petty
spite, and finally to fall into decay and ruin. Now she lives
evermore as she was in that fight, a glorious inspiration to
every son of England.</p>

<p>We observe, in the first place, that the rhythm is very
pronounced. It reminds us of the rhythm of <cite>The Ride from
Ghent</cite>, and suggests, in fact, what we soon discover to be
true, that the two poems are in spirit very closely allied.</p>

<p>l. 2-6 are intended to win our sympathy for the hero.
Observe his courage in riding unarmed and alone.</p>

<p>l. 10.&mdash;The accent on <em>gallant</em> is on the final syllable.
Observe how the emphasis on <em>-lant</em>, <em>came</em>, and <em>late</em> retards the
movement and suggests the contrast between Lochinvar’s hope
and his failure to arrive in time.</p>

<p>l. 11.&mdash;Note the contempt in <em>laggard</em> and <em>dastard</em>. Also
in line 16, where the movement is again retarded.</p>

<p>l. 19-24.&mdash;How cleverly Lochinvar conceals his true
intention, under the guise of indifference!</p>

<p>l. 20.&mdash;Love swells like ocean tides, but diminishes with
equal rapidity: I can get along without your daughter.</p>

<p>l. 32.&mdash;<em>Galliard</em>: a lively dance.</p>

<p>l. 33-34.&mdash;Bring out the pictures clearly. Do not slur.</p>

<p>l. 37.&mdash;Accelerate the movement, but not with a manufactured
speed. Catch the spirit of haste and the movement
will accelerate itself.</p>

<p>l. 41-42.&mdash;Note the triumphant joy of Lochinvar.</p>

<p>l. 41.&mdash;<em>Scaur</em>: a steep bank; pronounced <em>scar</em>.</p>

<p>l. 43-45.&mdash;The lively movement continues throughout
these lines.</p>

<p>l. 46.&mdash;This is a summary. The time will be slow when
we recognize and endeavor to express the full import of the

<p>It is to be hoped that the following notes will be carefully
considered. Inflections are most subtle indications of interpretation,
and their meaning none too well apprehended.
Time spent in such an analysis as that herein undertaken
should solve all the ordinary difficulties of the class-room.</p>

<p>l. 1.&mdash;Incomplete, hence rising inflection<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> on <em>Prairie</em>.</p>

<p>l. 2.&mdash;The same inflection on <em>Quarry</em>.</p>

<p>l. 3-5.&mdash;(<em>a</em>) <em>Gitche Manito</em> is the central idea; hence there
will be more force on those words. (<em>b</em>) Note that <em>descending</em>
is separated from the next line by a comma. This is a good
illustration of the function of punctuation; for if the comma
were not inserted we should read, <em>descending On the red
crags of the quarry</em>, and should not learn of our mistake until
we came to the next line.</p>

<p>l. 6.&mdash;<em>Nations</em>: falling inflection. A good illustration of
the principle that punctuation does not determine inflection:
the sense is complete, and the falling inflection instinctively
denotes that fact. The whole paragraph is pointing forward
to the main statement, <em>called the nations</em>. There might be
some reason in the use of a falling inflection on <em>erect</em>, but
perhaps the other interpretation is to be preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 8-9.&mdash;Falling inflections on <em>river</em> and on <em>morning</em>.</p>

<p>l. 10.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>downward</em>. There is likelihood
of misinterpretation here. Paraphrased, lines 10 and 11
are equivalent to, And the river, plunging downward over
the precipice, gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.</p>

<p>l. 11.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>Ishkoodah</em>, because the river
did not gleam like the comet Ishkoodah, but like Ishkoodah,
which is the Indian name for comet.</p>

<p>l. 12.&mdash;<em>Stooping earthward</em>: subordinate idea.</p>

<p>l. 12-15.&mdash;It is surprising how careless pupils are in reading
these lines. They nearly always read them to convey the
idea that the Spirit stooped earthward with his finger on the
meadow. Observe how the meaning is brought out by the
following reading:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry fs120">
<p class="verse0">And the Spirit (<em>pause</em>), stooping earthẃard (<em>pause</em>),</p>
<p class="verse0">With his finger (<em>pause</em>) on the meadoẃ (<em>pause</em>),</p>
<p class="verse0">Traced a winding pathẁay for it̀ (<em>pause</em>),</p>
<p class="verse0">Saying to it́́ (<em>pause</em>), “Run in th̀is way!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>l. 17-19.&mdash;The melody is virtually the same in each of
these lines, with a falling inflection on <em>fragment</em>, <em>pipe-head</em>
and <em>figures</em>.</p>

<p>l. 21.&mdash;Rising inflection preferable on <em>pipe-stem</em>. The
poem abounds in lines ending with falling inflections;
hence, one should be on the alert for such lines as this.</p>

<p>l. 23.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>willow</em>.</p>

<p>l. 25-26.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>forest</em> and on <em>together</em>.
We note that these two lines point forward.</p>

<p>l. 28-31.&mdash;Rising inflections throughout, even on <em>calumet</em>,
upon which word the pupil often errs.</p>

<p>l. 30.&mdash;<em>The Peace-Pipe</em> is not a subordinate idea; it is an
idea coördinate with <em>calumet</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 32.&mdash;Observe the rhythmic change and its meaning.</p>

<p>l. 33.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>morning</em>. Lines 32 and 33
contain the general statement, and</p>

<p>l. 34-39 contain the particular. When we perceive this
latter fact we will use the rising inflection at the end of each
line until we reach <em>heaven</em> in line 39, when, of course, we
shall have the falling.</p>

<p>l. 37.&mdash;Subordinate.</p>

<p>l. 40.&mdash;Observe that <em>broke</em> is the emphatic word, not
<em>against</em>. Rising inflection on <em>heaven</em>.</p>

<p>l. 42-46.&mdash;It is an open question whether we should use a
rising or a falling inflection at the end of each of these lines.
To use the falling would convey the idea that each detail was
important; to use the rising, to lay the stress upon the whole.
(See Momentary Completeness, <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>, <em>et seq.</em>) The former
reading seems the better.</p>

<p>l. 51.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>Behold it</em>.</p>

<p>l. 53-54.&mdash;Subordinate.</p>

<p>l. 56.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>l. 58.&mdash;An interesting point is presented in this line. The
poet intends to convey the idea that some tribes came <em>down
the rivers</em> and others <em>o’er the prairies</em>. Hence the melody
and force of the two phrases will be identical.</p>

<p>l. 59.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>nations</em>.</p>

<p>l. 60-65.&mdash;The most natural interpretation seems to be to
use a rising inflection on the name of the first tribe in each
line, and a falling on the second.</p>

<p>l. 66-67.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>together</em> and on <em>Peace-Pipe</em>.</p>

<p>l. 68.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>Prairie</em>.</p>

<p>l. 70.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>meadow</em>.</p>

<p>l. 71-74.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>war-gear</em>, <em>Autumn</em>,
<em>morning</em>, and <em>other</em>.</p>

<p>l. 74.&mdash;This is the strongest line of the four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 75-76.&mdash;<em>Faces</em> and <em>hearts</em> are not contrasted. The
melody of the two lines is virtually the same.</p>

<p>l. 81.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>compassion</em>.</p>

<p>l. 86.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>hand</em> is to be preferred.</p>

<p>l. 87-89.&mdash;These three lines should be construed as one
idea. Hence rising inflection will be given on <em>natures</em> and
on <em>fever</em>.</p>

<p>l. 90-93.&mdash;Rising inflections on <em>majestic</em>, <em>waters</em>, <em>warning</em>,
<em>chiding</em>. Why? Falling inflection on <em>abysses</em>.
Why?</p>

<p>l. 94.&mdash;Does he use rising inflection or falling on <em>children</em>?
What would be the difference in the idea conveyed by
each?</p>

<p>l. 95-96.&mdash;Do these lines mean “Will you not listen?”
If so they are full of pleading. If the speaker is imperative
the inflection will be falling.</p>

<p>l. 98.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>Life</em>. Observe how meaningful
are the words <em>who made you</em>.</p>

<p>l. 99-105.&mdash;Shall there be rising or falling inflection at
the end of these lines? What would each convey respectively?</p>

<p>l. 112.&mdash;Observe the radical change in the speaker’s
attitude. He has been asserting; now he argues and
pleads.</p>

<p>l. 116-117.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>you</em> and on <em>nations</em>.</p>

<p>l. 118.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>guide</em>.</p>

<p>l. 119.&mdash;<em>Toil</em> and <em>suffer</em> should be joined together, with
the main pause after <em>suffer</em>. Do not emphasize <em>with</em>.</p>

<p>l. 121.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>multiply</em>.</p>

<p>l. 122.&mdash;Note the contrast on <em>unheeded</em>.</p>

<p>l. 124-127.&mdash;Falling inflection on all the emphatic words.
There will be a tendency to use the rising inflection on <em>war-paint</em>,
<em>blood-stains</em>, <em>war-clubs</em>.</p>

<p>l. 128.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>quarry</em>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 130.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>l. 131.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>feathers</em>.</p>

<p>l. 133.&mdash;Principal pause after <em>brothers</em>, with perhaps a
brief pause after <em>live</em>.</p>

<p>l. 134.&mdash;Short pause after <em>then</em>; longer after <em>ground</em>.</p>

<p>l. 135.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>deer-skin</em> seems preferable.</p>

<p>l. 136.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>war-gear</em>.</p>

<p>l. 138.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>faces</em>.</p>

<p>l. 139.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>water</em>.</p>

<p>l. 140.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>limpid</em>.</p>

<p>l. 142.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>water</em>.</p>

<p>l. 143-144.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>crimson</em> and on <em>blood</em>.</p>

<p>l. 134-144.&mdash;This is the climax of the poem. When one
grasps this idea the voice becomes full of joy. Be sure to get
the picture of the clear and limpid water as it flows down to
where the warriors are, and note the change as it passes <em>below</em>
them, tinged with the war-paint it has washed away. Note
the emphasis on <em>clear above</em>, and on <em>dark below</em>.</p>

<p>l. 145.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>warriors</em>.</p>

<p>l. 148.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>weapons</em>.</p>

<p>l. 149-150.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>mighty</em> and on <em>creator</em>.</p>

<p>l. 151.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>smiled</em>.</p>

<p>l. 152.&mdash;Pause after <em>silence</em>; rising inflection on <em>warriors</em>.</p>

<p>l. 153.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>quarry</em>.</p>

<p>l. 154.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>Peace-Pipes</em>.</p>

<p>l. 155-156.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>river</em>, <em>feathers</em>.</p>

<p>l. 158.&mdash;Note the pause after <em>ascending</em>. He ascended
<em>through</em> and <em>vanished in</em>.</p>

<p>l. 158-160.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>Life</em>, <em>ascending</em>, <em>curtains</em>,
and <em>heaven</em>.</p>

<p>l. 161.&mdash;Falling inflection on <em>vanished</em>; rising on <em>faces</em>.</p>

<p>l. 162.&mdash;It seems that the rising inflection would be
preferable on <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>In the following poem it is purposed to offer comments
principally as to the movement. There is nothing that conduces
more to variety in reading than frequent changes in
movement. Not that these changes should be haphazard; on
the contrary, as we have seen in Chapter I, there is a definite
principle underlying movement. The analysis should reveal
that the various ideas are of different degrees of importance,
and the recognition of these differences will lead to the
variety of movement.</p>

<p>Attention is also directed to transitions, and occasionally
to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Every comment should be carefully considered and challenged.
The printed page is a monochrome of type. The
danger is, therefore, that we read monotonously. With the
years we acquire a fatal facility for pronouncing words without
getting the underlying thought. The object of these
analyses is to take the mind from the words to the ideas which
they express, and so to improve the reading.</p>

the movement slow and the atmosphere dignified.</p>

<p>l. 5.&mdash;Note the repetition and its effect on the movement.</p>

<p>l. 7.&mdash;Rather fast.</p>

<p>l. 8.&mdash;According to the importance we attach to this line
will be the rate of movement. If it means simply in all
directions, the time will be moderate. If, however, we desire
to emphasize that the messengers rode far to the east, and far
to the west, and so forth, the time will be slow. Probably
the former is the better interpretation.</p>

and terror that pervades the entire stanza.</p>

endless.</p>

49. Hence there will be a rising inflection at the end of

despair.</p>

it is sufficient to suggest the fact that he is calling, and his
fear. The time will be fast.</p>

<p>l. 70.&mdash;Observe the change in time and atmosphere.</p>

<p>l. 73.&mdash;A good illustration of the principle underlying
movement. This line is read slowly, for it announces the
doom of the city.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXI</p>

<p>l. 74-75.&mdash;Moderate time.</p>

<p>l. 76-79.&mdash;Note that the time grows gradually slower as the
mind becomes more and more engrossed with the picture, and
how the voice swells with increasing grandeur.</p>

<p>l. 80-85.&mdash;Prevailingly moderate movement.</p>

<p>l. 84.&mdash;Rising inflection on <em>bright</em> because the speaker no
doubt has in mind the two lines, 84 and 85.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXV</p>

<p>The hatred and contempt of the speaker will color the
entire stanza. The movement will be on the whole moderate.</p>

<p>l. 88.&mdash;Slow.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXVI</p>

<p>l. 94.&mdash;Slower time, and an atmosphere of sadness. Bear
in mind the speaker sympathizes with the Consul.</p>

<p>l. 98.&mdash;Despair and sadness.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXVII</p>

<p>l. 102-103.&mdash;Manifest the speaker’s pride in Horatius, and
note the striking contrast between the atmosphere of these lines
and that of the concluding lines of the preceding stanza.</p>

<p>l. 104-109.&mdash;Solemn and deliberate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXIX</p>

<p>l. 110-115.&mdash;Note the change in Horatius.</p>

<p>l. 116-117.&mdash;As if addressing the crowd; a marked transition.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXX</p>

<p>A good study in variety; nearly every line presents a
change of atmosphere.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXXI</p>

<p>l. 126-127.&mdash;Very deliberately the Consul speaks. Why?
What are his feelings?</p>

<p>l. 128-129.&mdash;Observe the patriotic ring in the speaker’s
words.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXXIV</p>

<p>The stanza is in simple narrative style, and contains but
little emotion. The significant idea is that the patricians in
this hour of trial worked side by side with plebeians.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXXV</p>

<p>The time is moderate at the beginning, becoming gradually
slower to the end.</p>

<p>Observe the change in atmosphere in the last line. Once
more it is well to remind the reader that the speaker is a
patriot.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXXVI</p>

<p>The movement of the first two lines is rather slow; after
that it accelerates to the end, in sympathy with the fast moving
picture.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XXXVIII</p>

<p>The atmosphere is that of struggle and of the joy of victory.</p>

<p>The time will be rather fast, retarding towards the close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XL</p>

<p>l. 170-173.&mdash;See note on preceding stanza.</p>

<p>l. 174.&mdash;Transition. Observe the hate of Horatius.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLI</p>

<p>The time is prevailingly slow, and the atmosphere in
marked contrast to that of the preceding stanza. There is,
too, a note of contempt and irony.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLII</p>

<p>l. 189.&mdash;Abrupt transition to atmosphere of what is almost
fear. Time fast.</p>

<p>l. 190-196.&mdash;Time slow, and atmosphere in sympathy with
the size and strength of Astur.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLIII</p>

<p>l. 197-198.&mdash;Observe the contrast between the atmosphere
of these lines and that of the succeeding two.</p>

<p>l. 201-202.&mdash;Astur’s contempt for his own allies.</p>

<p>l. 203.&mdash;Boastfully.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLIV</p>

<p>l. 205-208.&mdash;Fast and strong.</p>

<p>l. 209-210.&mdash;Fast.</p>

<p>l. 211-212.&mdash;Slower, and note change in feeling: Horatius
is wounded.</p>

<p>l. 213-214.&mdash;The joy of the enemy serves but to increase
the speaker’s sorrow.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLV</p>

<p>l. 217-222.&mdash;Note the intensity of the speaker’s feeling
and his savage joy at the close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLVI</p>

<p>Slow time throughout.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza XLVII</p>

<p>l. 227.&mdash;Moderate time.</p>

<p>l. 231-234.&mdash;Transition to the proud and contemptuous
defiance of Horatius. The time is moderate; the key is high,
because Horatius is calling to the opposing army.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LI</p>

<p>l. 235-236.&mdash;Simple narrative.</p>

<p>l. 237-238.&mdash;Contemptuous.</p>

<p>l. 239-242.&mdash;Sarcastic throughout. Time quite slow.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LII</p>

<p>l. 246.&mdash;Very slow and contemptuous, especially the last
four words. Falling inflection on <em>dread</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LIII</p>

<p>l. 251.&mdash;Note the transition.</p>

<p>l. 251-254.&mdash;Rather fast.</p>

<p>l. 255.&mdash;Suggest the sustained call and the warning.</p>

<p>l. 256.&mdash;Subordinate.</p>

<p>l. 257-258.&mdash;Faster and with greater trepidation.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LIV</p>

<p>l. 259-262.&mdash;Fast.</p>

<p>l. 263.&mdash;Transition.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LV</p>

<p>This stanza is the climax of the poem. Horatius’ work is
done! The atmosphere is that of joy, triumph, and exultation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LVI</p>

<p>The excitement of the speaker carries him on with headlong
speed as he recalls the picture described in this stanza.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LVII</p>

<p>l. 284.&mdash;The excitement subsides.</p>

<p>l. 286-287.&mdash;No hope.</p>

<p>l. 289.&mdash;What is the emotion of Sextus? Note the <em>smile</em>.</p>

<p>l. 290.&mdash;Observe the difference between Lars Porsena and
Sextus in their feelings toward Horatius.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LVIII</p>

<p>l. 292.&mdash;Slower time. Is there not a note of pride in the
speaker’s voice as he recalls the bravery of Horatius?</p>

<p>l. 297-299.&mdash;Tender and slow.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LIX</p>

<p>l. 300-303.&mdash;Slow and reverential.</p>

<p>l. 304-307.&mdash;Rather fast, with pause before and after
<em>headlong</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LX</p>

<p>l. 308-312.&mdash;Rather slow.</p>

<p>l. 313.&mdash;Note transition to the feeling of joy.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LXI</p>

<p>The entire stanza is permeated with the speaker’s suspense
and with his sympathy with the struggles of the wounded
man.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LXIII</p>

<p>Observe again the contrast between Sextus and Lars Porsena,
both enemies of Horatius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">Stanza LXIV</p>

<p>If we will follow the picture and describe it as we see it
and as the speaker now recalls it, we will make long pauses
after <em>bottom</em> and <em>stands</em>.</p>

<p>The time increases in rapidity through the first four lines,
and then is retarded to the end.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the first four lines is that of joy, and it
is hardly possible to keep back the tears as we utter the last
four.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the final selection we shall call attention to all the
interpretative difficulties which the teacher is likely to meet
with in the class-room. There is no reason why such a piece
of literature as this cannot be used to advantage even in the
public school, provided we take the time for careful analysis.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A few words of introduction are first necessary. We
should understand the play as a whole, and be conversant with
the events that lead up to this particular scene; further, we
should bear in mind the tense, splenetic character of Cassius,
and the calm, controlled, stoical disposition of Brutus.</p>

<p>l. 1.&mdash;In Scene 2 we get the keynote to Cassius’ manner.
He is so full of his supposed wrong that he pays no heed to
the surroundings, and bluntly plunges into the matter in
hand. Brutus restrains him, and together they move to the
former’s tent. No sooner do they enter than again Cassius
bursts forth.</p>

<p>l. 4.&mdash;Cassius is piqued that his letters should have failed
to shield Lucius Pella from the punishment for his wrongdoing.</p>

<p>l. 5.&mdash;Subordinate and explanatory.</p>

<p>l. 6.&mdash;Brutus’s answer is simple and direct, yet without
feeling.</p>

<p>l. 8.&mdash;<em>Nice</em> is equivalent to unimportant, small. There is
a touch of contempt in this speech.</p>

<p>l. 9.&mdash;Again we note the directness of Brutus’s statement,
and the absence of feeling. Note, too, that he in no way
seeks to soften his charges.</p>

<p>l. 12.&mdash;Imagine the surprise and rage of Cassius. There
will be a sweeping upward inflection on <em>I</em>. It is only with
the utmost effort that the fiery Cassius can control himself.</p>

<p>l. 15-16.&mdash;Paraphrased, these lines mean, The name of
Cassius is associated with this corruption, and hence the
hands of justice are tied. For, to bring the corrupters to trial
would be to drag in Cassius with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>l. 17.&mdash;Do you dare to use the term <em>chastisement</em> in connection
with <em>my</em> name?</p>

<p>l. 18.&mdash;Unmoved by the anger of Cassius, Brutus
proceeds calmly and perhaps too ruthlessly to arraign his
friend.</p>

<p>l. 21.&mdash;Observe the high moral standard of Brutus.</p>

<p>l. 21-26.&mdash;Rising inflections throughout.</p>

<p>l. 27.&mdash;Observe the contempt.</p>

<p>l. 28.&mdash;During the speech of Brutus, Cassius can scarcely
contain himself. Never has any one dared to arraign him.
Now he is even forgetting the deference he has been wont to
show to one whom he recognizes as his superior.</p>

<p>l. 32-34.&mdash;Rapidly, as the passion of the men rises.</p>

<p>l. 35-36.&mdash;Now Cassius begins to threaten.</p>

<p>l. 37.&mdash;There is no anger in this. Brutus knows that
Cassius is beside himself, and brushes him aside as one would
brush an insignificant dust speck from his clothing.</p>

<p>l. 38.&mdash;Such treatment Cassius cannot understand. The
line is exclamatory rather than interrogative. It is equivalent
to, Can I believe my ears?</p>

<p>l. 38.&mdash;Brutus now begins to assert himself. It is a new
aspect of his character, which we can comprehend only when
we learn, as we do later, that Portia is dead.</p>

<p>l. 40.&mdash;Brutus must be greatly moved to call his dearest
friend a madman.</p>

<p>l. 41.&mdash;The strain of listening to such words is becoming
too great for Cassius to bear.</p>

<p>l. 42.&mdash;Brutus seems almost to enjoy the terrible lesson he
is reading Cassius. It is well-nigh incredible that the
thoughtful, loving husband of Portia, and the considerate
master of Lucius, should speak thus to any one, let alone his
best friend.</p>

<p>l. 50.&mdash;There seems to be no feeling but surprise in this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
surprise verging on bewilderment. As Brutus grows more
passionate Cassius seems to subside.</p>

<p>l. 51-54.&mdash;It is Brutus now who appears to lose self-control.
Cassius never said he was a better soldier.</p>

<p>l. 55-57.&mdash;Anger and bewilderment give way to a sense of
having been wronged: the last sentence is almost pathetic in
its humility.</p>

<p>l. 57.&mdash;Anger and contempt.</p>

<p>l. 58.&mdash;Cassius’ passion is again beginning to rise.</p>

<p>l. 59-62.&mdash;Note the increasing astonishment in the
speeches of Cassius, and the superciliousness of Brutus.</p>

<p>l. 63-64.&mdash;A threat uttered not so much in anger as in fear
that he may not be able to control his feelings.</p>

<p>l. 65.&mdash;<em>Have</em> and <em>should</em> are the emphatic words.</p>

<p>l. 65-82.&mdash;This speech needs no commentary. It is a
plain and unmistakable arraignment, uttered in unequivocal
language, and in simple, direct manner.</p>

<p>l. 82.&mdash;Cassius is pained that his friend should so misunderstand
him. From now to line 93 Cassius seems to
throw himself upon the mercy of his friend, while the latter
repels his advances, each time with greater harshness.</p>

<p>l. 93-107.&mdash;Cassius’ heart is broken. If his best friend
can so wantonly misunderstand him, what can he hope from
his enemies? There is nothing left to live for, and he would
eagerly welcome death even at the hands of Antony. The
passage is overflowing with heartbreak, and gains our sympathy
for one who else would seem but a crafty, self-seeking schemer.</p>

<p>l. 107.&mdash;The speech of Cassius brings Brutus back to himself.
Here is the real Brutus, full of tenderness and love.</p>

<p>To understand fully the unusual display of feeling in this
scene we should read further to the stage direction, <em>Re-enter
Lucius, with wine and taper</em>.</p>

should be the spontaneous outcome of the mental action. As
has been so often stated, to tell a pupil to use a rising inflection or to

of correct teaching.</p></div>

A fool, a fool!&mdash;I met a fool, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.<br />
<br />
A land of streams, <a href="#Page_240">240</a>.<br />
<br />
Alas! my noble boy! <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.<br />
<br />
Among the exploits of marvelous, <a href="#Page_152">152</a>.<br />
<br />
And as a hungry lion, <a href="#Page_79">79</a>.<br />
<br />
And do you now put on your best attire, <a href="#Page_140">140</a>.<br />
<br />
And now go bring your sharpest torments, <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.<br />
<br />
And the evening star was shining, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>.<br />
<br />
And the old Tartar came upon the sand, <a href="#Page_185">185</a>.<br />
<br />
And thus King Priam supplicating, <a href="#Page_165">165</a>.<br />
<br />
And you,&mdash;you who are, <a href="#Page_152">152</a>.<br />

Antonio, I am married to a wife, <a href="#Page_44">44</a>.<br />
<br />
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.<br />
<br />
As thro’ the land at eve we went, <a href="#Page_200">200</a>.<br />
<br />
As when a boar or lion, <a href="#Page_164">164</a>.<br />
<br />
As when some hunter in the spring, <a href="#Page_203">203</a>.<br />
<br />

At the moment when death, <a href="#Page_38">38</a>.<br />
<br />
Awake, my soul! Not only passive praise, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before a quarter pole was pass’d, <a href="#Page_24">24</a>.<br />
<br />
Blessings on thee, little man, <a href="#Page_175">175</a>.<br />

Blow trumpet, for the world, <a href="#Page_201">201</a>.<br />

But in the gloom they fought, <a href="#Page_107">107</a>.<br />

But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth, <a href="#Page_201">201</a>.<br />
<br />
But when public taste, <a href="#Page_79">79</a>.<br />
<br />
But when the gray dawn stole into his tent, <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did your letters pierce, <a href="#Page_188">188</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear! <a href="#Page_162">162</a>.<br />

Figure to yourself a cataract, <a href="#Page_22">22</a>.<br />

For even then, Sir, even before, <a href="#Page_112">112</a>.<br />

Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth, <a href="#Page_153">153</a>.<br />

Gloriously, Max! gloriously! <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.<br />
<br />
Great have thy sufferings been, <a href="#Page_166">166</a>.<br />
<br />
Gusty and raw was the morning, <a href="#Page_193">193</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Half a league, half a league, <a href="#Page_236">236</a>.<br />

Haste thee, nymph, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_239">239</a>.<br />
<br />
Hear the sledges with the bells, <a href="#Page_98">98</a>.<br />
<br />
Hector, thou almost ever chidest me, <a href="#Page_164">164</a>.<br />
<br />
Here are old trees, <a href="#Page_239">239</a>.<br />

He spoke, and Sohrab kindled, <a href="#Page_202">202</a>.<br />
<br />
He spoke; but Rustum gazed, <a href="#Page_162">162</a>.<br />
<br />
Him the Almighty power, <a href="#Page_242">242</a>.<br />
<br />
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, <a href="#Page_112">112</a>.<br />

<br />
<br />
I can not tell what you and other men, <a href="#Page_180">180</a>.<br />
<br />
I come, I come ye have called, <a href="#Page_239">239</a>.<br />
<br />
If there be three in all your company, <a href="#Page_207">207</a>.<br />
<br />
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now, <a href="#Page_162">162</a>.<br />
<br />
I had a dream, <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.<br />
<br />
I know that virtue to be in you, <a href="#Page_217">217</a>.<br />

<br />
In the furrowed land, <a href="#Page_134">134</a>.<br />

I sprang to the stirrup, <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.<br />

It is but a legend, I know, <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.<br />
<br />
It is but change, Titinius, <a href="#Page_144">144</a>.<br />
<br />
It is my purpose, therefore, <a href="#Page_155">155</a>.<br />

Let me play the fool, <a href="#Page_97">97</a>.<br />

Look! look! that livid flash! <a href="#Page_240">240</a>.<br />
